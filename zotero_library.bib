	abstract = {One of the most challenging aspects of biomechanical modelling is parameter estimation. Parameter values that define the nonlinear relations within the classic Hill-based muscle model structure have been estimated for a large number of muscles involved in movements of a number of joints. The technique used to estimate these parameters is based on combining information on muscle as a material with geometrical data on muscle-joint anatomy. The resulting relations are compatible with available human experimental data and with past modelling estimates. An estimation of the relative importance of the various synergistic muscle properties during dynamic movement tasks is also provided, aided by examples of muscle load-sharing as a function of optimization criteria including measures of position error, muscle stress and neural effort.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a musculo-skeletal model of the upper limb is presented. The limb is modelled as a three-dimensional 7 degrees-of-freedom system, linked to the shoulder, which has been considered as frame. The upper limb model is made up of four links corresponding to the most important body segments: the humerus, the ulna, the radius and the hand, considered as a single rigid body. Particular attention has been paid to the modelling of joints in order to mimic all the possible arm and forearm movements (including prono-supination). The model also includes 24 muscles. The mathematical model used to describe the muscles is that proposed by Zajac in 1989, modified by the authors. The kinematic analysis has been performed including an ergonomics index to take into account the posture and joint physical limits. Moreover an optimization criterion based on minimum activation pattern has been included in order to find muscular activation coefficients. The results of the proposed methodology concerning muscular activations have been compared to those coming from processed EMG signals, which have been acquired during experimental tests.},

	abstract = {Functional morphologists have traditionally regarded cost of locomotion as an important influence on the design of locomotor structures. If cost of locomotion is an important constraint in the natural selection of these structures, it should be possible to show that animals differing in limb morphology also differ in their locomotor costs. In previous experiments on three species of cursorial mammals differing considerably in limb structure, no such differences were detected. Since the factors that determine the rate of energy consumption of a running animal are not well understood, we felt that the effect of limb morphology on cost could best be examined in a system in which only the inertial properties of limbs were varied while other factors remained constant. Consequently, we have measured changes in the rate of energy consumption of running human subjects produced by artificial alterations in limb inertial properties. Other variables that might influence cost have been controlled. We found that the cost of adding a given mass to the limbs is significantly greater than adding it to the centre of mass and that this effect becomes more pronounced as the limb loads are moved distally. Thus a clear effect of limb mass and its distribution on cost of locomotion has been demonstrated.},

	abstract = {We test the predictive value of the main energetic currencies used in foraging theory using starlings that choose between two foraging modes (walking versus flying). Walking is low-cost, low-yield, whereas flying is the opposite. We fixed experimentally, at 11 different values, the amount of flight required to get one food reward, and for each flight cost value, we titrated the amount of walking until the birds showed indifference between foraging modes. We then compared the indifference points to those predicted by gross rate of gain over time, net rate of gain over time, and the ratio of gain to expenditure (efficiency). The results for the choice between modes show strong qualitative and quantitative support for net rate of gain over time over the alternatives. However, the birds foraged for only a fraction of the available time, indicating that the choice between foraging and resting could not be explained by any of these currencies. We suggest that this discrepancy could be accounted for functionally because nonenergetic factors such as predation risk may differ between resting and foraging in any mode but may not differ much between foraging modes, hence releasing the choice between foraging modes from the influence of such factors. Alternatively, the discrepancy may be attributable to the use of predictable (rather than stochastic) ratios of effort per prey in our experiment, and it may thus be better understood with mechanistic rather than functional arguments.},

	abstract = {The proposition that dynamic optimization provides better estimates of muscle forces during gait than static optimization is examined by comparing a dynamic solution with two static solutions. A 23-degree-of-freedom musculoskeletal model actuated by 54 Hill-type musculotendon units was used to simulate one cycle of normal gait. The dynamic problem was to find the muscle excitations which minimized metabolic energy per unit distance traveled, and which produced a repeatable gait cycle. In the dynamic problem, activation dynamics was described by a first-order differential equation. The joint moments predicted by the dynamic solution were used as input to the static problems. In each static problem, the problem was to find the muscle activations which minimized the sum of muscle activations squared, and which generated the joint moments input from the dynamic solution. In the first static problem, muscles were treated as ideal force generators; in the second, they were constrained by their force–length–velocity properties; and in both, activation dynamics was neglected. In terms of predicted muscle forces and joint contact forces, the dynamic and static solutions were remarkably similar. Also, activation dynamics and the force–length–velocity properties of muscle had little influence on the static solutions. Thus, for normal gait, if one can accurately solve the inverse dynamics problem and if one seeks only to estimate muscle forces, the use of dynamic optimization rather than static optimization is currently not justified. Scenarios in which the use of dynamic optimization is justified are suggested.},

	abstract = {A subject-specific model of instantaneous cost of transport (ICOT) is introduced from the joint-space formulation of metabolic energy expenditure using the laws of thermodynamics and the principles of multibody system dynamics. Work and heat are formulated in generalized coordinates as functions of joint kinematic and dynamic variables. Generalized heat rates mapped from muscle energetics are estimated from experimental walking metabolic data for the whole body, including upper-body and bilateral data synchronization. Identified subject-specific energetic parameters—mass, height, (estimated) maximum oxygen uptake, and (estimated) maximum joint torques—are incorporated into the heat rate, as opposed to the traditional in vitro and subject-invariant muscle parameters. The total model metabolic energy expenditure values are within 5.7 ± 4.6\% error of the measured values with strong (R2 {\textgreater} 0.90) inter- and intra-subject correlations. The model reliably predicts the characteristic convexity and magnitudes (0.326–0.348) of the experimental total COT (0.311–0.358) across different subjects and speeds. The ICOT as a function of time provides insights into gait energetic causes and effects (e.g., normalized comparison and sensitivity with respect to walking speed) and phase-specific COT, which are unavailable from conventional metabolic measurements or muscle models. Using the joint-space variables from commonly measured or simulated data, the models enable real-time and phase-specific evaluations of transient or non-periodic general tasks that use a range of (aerobic) energy pathway similar to that of steady-state walking.},

	abstract = {The hypothesis is advanced that the specific patterns of motor unit recruitment and stimulation frequencies observed in mammalian skeletal muscle under static isometric contractions are determined by a minimum-energy principle. By performing a constrained energy optimization based on a control model of skeletal muscle comprising three different fibre types, and appropriate expressions for the energy rates, it is indeed possible to obtain detailed predictions of recruitment and stimulation frequency patterns which agree well with the experimentally observed functions, thereby providing strong support for the minimum-energy hypothesis. Since the orderly recruitment sequence determined by the size principle is also, independently, predicted by the minimum-energy principle, it is concluded that there exists a relationship between motor unit size and the myoenergetic properties of the recruited unit. It is suggested that this relationship, together with the possibility of adjusting the relative proportions of the fibre types present in a muscle, constitutes an optimal adaptation of the neuromuscular system for practically all types of muscular performances normally encountered. For various types of muscles, the energy rates as functions of the force output are also discussed.},

	abstract = {Heat production and force were measured during tetani of single muscle fibres from anterior tibialis of frog. During stimulation fibres were either kept under isometric conditions, or were stretched or allowed to shorten (at constant velocity) after isometric force had reached its plateau value. The energy change was evaluated as the sum of heat and work (work = integral of force with respect to length change). Net energy absorption occurred during stretch at velocities greater than about 0.35 L0 s−1 (L0 is fibre length at resting sarcomere length 2.10 μm). Heat produced by 1 mm segments of the fibre was measured simultaneously and separately; energy absorption is not an artefact due to patchy heat production. The maximum energy absorption, 0.092 ± 0.002 P0L0 (mean ±s.e.m., n = 8; where P0 is isometric force at L0), occurred during the fastest stretches (1.64 L0 s−1) and amounted to more than half of the work done on the fibre. Energy absorption occurred in two phases. The amount in the first phase, 0.027 ± 0.003 P0L0 (n = 32), was independent of velocity beyond 0.18 L0 s−1. The quantity absorbed in the second phase increased with velocity and did not reach a limiting value in the range of velocities used. After stretch, energy was produced in excess of the isometric rate, probably from dissipation of the stored energy. About 34 \% (0.031 P0L0/0.092 P0L0) of the maximum absorbed energy could be stored elastically (in crossbridges, tendons, thick, thin and titin filaments) and by redistribution of crossbridge states. The remaining energy could have been stored in stretching transverse, elastic connections between myofibrils.},

	abstract = {In this paper we develop a theory for calculating the chemical energy liberation and heat production of a skeletal muscle subjected to an arbitrary history of stimulation, loading, and length variation. This theory is based on and complements the distribution-moment (DM) model of muscle [Zahalak and Ma, J. biomech. Engng112, 52–62 (1990)]. The DM model is a mathematical approximation of the A. F. Huxley cross-bridge theory and represents a muscle in terms of five (normalized) state variables: A, the muscle length, c, the sarcoplasmic free calcium concentration, and Q0, Q1, Q2, the first three moments of the actin-myosin bond-distribution function (which, respectively, have macroscopic interpretations as the muscle stiffness, force, and elastic energy stored in the contractile tissue). From this model are derived two equations which predict the chemical energy liberation and heat production rates in terms of the five DM state variables, and which take account of the following factors: (1) phosphocreatine hydrolysis associated with cross-bridge cycling; (2) phosphocreatine hydrolysis associated with sarcoplasmic-reticulum pumping of calcium; (3) passive calcium flux across the sarcoplasmic-reticulum membrane; (4) calcium-troponin bonding; (5) cross-bridge bonding at zero strain; (6) cross-bridge strain energy; (7) tendon strain energy; and (8) external work. Using estimated parameters appropriate for a frog sartorius at 0°C, the energy rates are calculated for several experiments reported in the literature, and reasonable agreement is found between our model and the measurements. (The selected experiments are confined to the plateau of the isometric length-tension curve, although our theory admits arbitrary length variations.) The two most important contributions to the energy rates are phosphocreatine hydrolysis associated with cross-bridge cycling and with sarcoplasmic-reticulum calcium pumping, and these two contributions are approximately equal under tetanic, isometric, steady-state conditions. The contribution of the calcium flux across the electrochemical potential gradient at the sarcoplasmic-reticulum membrane was found to be small under all conditions examined, and can be neglected. Long-term fatigue and oxidative recovery effects are not included in this theory. Also not included is the so-called “unexplained energy” presumably associated with reactions which have not yet been identified. Within these limitations our model defines clear quantitative interrelations between the activation, mechanics, and energetics in muscle, and permits rational estimates of the energy production to be calculated for arbitrary programs of muscular work.},

The restriction, in the previous model, to a constant number of stimulated motor units has been removed and the new model allows for both a varying number of stimulated motor units and a varying average stimulation rate. The general model is tested by comparing its predictions with experimental records of the force output of the quadriceps femoris muscle. It is found that the model correctly predicts the initial excitation-contraction delay, the dips in the force record, and several other contraction phenomena.},

The article emphasizes the advances in knowledge on the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the neuromodulation of motoneuron activity and attempts to explain the discharge characteristics of human motor units in terms of these principles.

	abstract = {Humans naturally select several parameters within a gait that correspond with minimizing metabolic cost. Much less is understood about the role of metabolic cost in selecting between gaits. Here, we asked participants to decide between walking or running out and back to different gait specific markers. The distance of the walking marker was adjusted after each decision to identify relative distances where individuals switched gait preferences. We found that neither minimizing solely metabolic energy nor minimizing solely movement time could predict how the group decided between gaits. Of our twenty participants, six behaved in a way that tended towards minimizing metabolic energy, while eight favoured strategies that tended more towards minimizing movement time. The remaining six participants could not be explained by minimizing a single cost. We provide evidence that humans consider not just a single movement cost, but instead a weighted combination of these conflicting costs with their relative contributions varying across participants. Individuals who placed a higher relative value on time ran faster than individuals who placed a higher relative value on metabolic energy. Sensitivity to temporal costs also explained variability in an individual's preferred velocity as a function of increasing running distance. Interestingly, these differences in velocity both within and across participants were absent in walking, possibly due to a steeper metabolic cost of transport curve. We conclude that metabolic cost plays an essential, but not exclusive role in gait decisions.},

This hope has been realized, and some astonishingly simple and accurate relations have been found, relations, moreover, which (among other things) determine the effect of load on speed of shortening, allow the form of the isometric contraction to be predicted, and are the basis of the so-called “visco-elasticity” of skeletal muscle. This paper is divided into three parts. In Part I further developments of the technique are described: everything has depended on the technique, so no apology is needed for a rather full description of it and of the precautions necessary. In Part II the results themselves are described and discussed. In Part III the “visco-elastic” properties of active muscle are shown to be a consequence of the properties described in Part II.},

It was quickly discovered by Edgar Adrian [1889–1977] and Detlev Bronk [1897–1975] that the force exerted by muscle during voluntary contractions was the result of the concurrent recruitment of motor units and modulation of the rate at which they discharged action potentials. Subsequent studies found that the relation between discharge frequency and motor unit force was characterized by a sigmoidal function. Based on observations on experimental animals, Elwood Henneman [1915–1996] proposed a “size principle” in 1957 and most studies in humans focussed on validating this concept during various types of muscle contractions. By the end of the 20th C, the experimental evidence indicated that the recruitment order of human motor units was determined primarily by motoneuron size and that the occasional changes in recruitment order were not an intended strategy of the central nervous system. Fundamental knowledge on the function of Sherrington's “common final pathway” was expanded with observations on motor unit rotation, minimal and maximal discharge rates, discharge variability, and self-sustained firing. Despite the great amount of work on characterizing motor unit activity during the first century of inquiry, however, many basic questions remain unanswered and these limit the extent to which findings on humans and experimental animals can be integrated and generalized to all movements.},

	abstract = {Muscle force is due to the cumulative effect of repetitively contracting motor units (MUs). To simulate the contribution of each MU to whole muscle force, an approach implemented in a novel computer program is proposed. The individual contraction of an MU (the twitch) is modeled by a 6-parameter analytical function previously proposed; the force of one MU is a sum of its contractions due to an applied stimulation pattern, and the muscle force is the sum of the active MUs. The number of MUs, the number of slow, fast-fatigue-resistant, and fast-fatigable MUs, and their six parameters as well as a file with stimulation patterns for each MU are inputs for the developed software. Different muscles and different firing patterns can be simulated changing the input data. The functionality of the program is illustrated with a model consisting of 30 MUs of rat medial gastrocnemius muscle. The twitches of these MUs were experimentally measured and modeled. The forces of the MUs and of the whole muscle were simulated using different stimulation patterns that included different regular, irregular, synchronous, and asynchronous firing patterns of MUs. The size principle of MUs for recruitment and derecruitment was also demonstrated using different stimulation paradigms.},

	abstract = {During voluntary contraction, firing rates of individual motor units (MUs) increase modestly over a narrow force range beyond which little additional increase in firing rate is seen. Such saturation of MU discharge may be a consequence of extrinsic factors that limit net synaptic excitation acting on motor neurons (MNs) or may be due to intrinsic properties of the MNs. Two sets of experiments involving recording of human biceps brachii MUs were carried out to evaluate saturation. In the first set, the extent of saturation was quantified for 136 low-threshold MUs during isometric ramp contractions. Firing rate-force data were best fit by a saturating function for 90\% of MUs recorded with a maximum rate of 14.8 ± 2.0 impulses/s. In the second set of experiments, to distinguish extrinsic from intrinsic factors underlying saturation, we artificially augmented descending excitatory drive to biceps MNs by activation of muscle spindle afferents through tendon vibration. We examined the change in firing rate caused by tendon vibration in 96 MUs that were voluntarily activated at rates below and at saturation. Vibration had little effect on the discharge of MUs that were firing at saturation frequencies but strongly increased firing rates of the same units when active at lower frequencies. These results indicate that saturation is likely caused by intrinsic mechanisms that prevent further increases in firing rate in the presence of increasing synaptic excitation. Possible intrinsic cellular mechanisms that limit firing rates of motor units during voluntary effort are discussed.},

Glycogen depletion of the motor unit was achieved through repetitive stimulation of either the intracellularly identified motoneuron or the functionally isolated motor axon. Muscle fibers belonging to the stimulated unit were identified in serial cross-sections, and in the cross-section which contained the most depleted fibers the centroid of each depleted fiber was determined. Subsequently, three spatial analyses, ie, a quadrat analysis, a point-to nearest neighbor analysis and an interfiber distance analysis, were used to determine if motor unit fibers were distributed randomly throughout the territory of the unit. Motor unit fibers tended to be localized within the muscle cross-section and were not evenly or homogeneously distributed throughout the territory. In general, the analyses suggested that motor unit fibers may be arranged in clusters or subgroups of varying size. The data demonstrate three different quantitative analyses for studying the organization of muscle fibers of normal motor units, which can be used for objective assessment and diagnosis of neuromuscular diseases.},

Experiment 2 dissociated speed, frequency, and stride length to show that the transition occurred at a constant speed near the energy separatrix. Results are consistent with a dynamic theory of locomotion in which preferred gaits are characterized by stable phase relationships and minimum energy expenditure, and gait transitions by a loss of stability and the reduction of energetic costs.},

We investigated the ability of four different versions of the DDM to explain the data in a real binary food choice task under conditions of high and low time pressure. We found that a seven-parameter version of the DDM can account for the choice and reaction time data with high-accuracy, in both the high and low time pressure conditions.

	abstract = {Interactions between physiological stimulus frequencies, fascicle lengths and velocities were analyzed in feline caudofemoralis (CF), a hindlimb skeletal muscle composed exclusively of fast-twitch fibers. Split ventral roots were stimulated asynchronously to produce smooth contractions at sub-tetanic stimulus frequencies. As described previously, the peak of the sub-tetanic force-length relationship was found to shift to longer lengths with decreases in stimulus frequency, indicating a length dependence for activation that is independent of filament overlap. The sub-tetanic force-velocity (FV) relationship was affected strongly both by stimulus frequency and by length; decreases in either decreased the slope of the FV relationship around isometric. The shapes of the force transients following stretch or shortening revealed that these effects were not due to a change in the instantaneous FV relationship; the relative shape of the force transients following stretch or shortening was independent of stimulus frequency and hardly affected by length. The effects of stimulus frequency and length on the sub-tetanic FV relationship instead appear to be caused by a time delay in the length-dependent changes of activation. In contrast to feline soleus muscle, which is composed exclusively of slow-twitch fibers, CF did not yield at sub-tetanic stimulus frequencies for the range of stretch velocities tested (up to 2 L0/s). The data presented here were used to build a model of muscle that accounted well for all of the effects described. We extended our model to account for slow twitch muscle by comparing our fast-twitch model with previously published data and then changing the necessary parameters to fit the data. Our slow-twitch model accounts well for all previous findings including that of yielding.},

Similar experiments were also carried out at other pedalling rates and using other leg muscles. 3. The relationships between each of the variables (integrated e.m.g., oxygen consumption) and mean torque on pedals were found to be linear (r greater than 0-98) with a remarkable degree of reproducibility in surface e.m.g. for each subject over several months. 4. The ratio of the e.m.g. slopes at 50 rev/min (positive/negative) was 1-96 +/- 0-12 while the same ratio for the oxygen uptake slopes was 6-34 +/- 0-82. The discrepancy between the ratios suggests that not only is less muscle fibre activity required to maintain the same exerted force during negative work exercise, but there is also a substantial reduction in the oxygen uptake when the fibres are stretched. This was observed for all speeds of pedalling.},

	abstract = {Anatomic and biomechanical properties of the passive brachioradialis muscle were investigated to understand the limited excursion of this muscle seen during tendon transfer surgery. First, architectural measurements were performed on three fiber bundles obtained from four regions of the brachioradialis (10 specimens) chosen to represent the range of muscle fiber lengths across the brachioradialis. Next, in separate specimens (eight specimens), passive excursion was measured by securing the distal tendon stump to a servomotor. A constant load of 4.9 N was applied to the tendon, while the distal tendon was released from the surrounding tissue in 3-cm increments. Within the four regions studied, muscle fiber length varied significantly from 104.2 +/- 6.2 mm to 179.8 +/- 6.1 mm. As the brachioradialis was released, an average of 3 mm of mobility was obtained for each interval whereas for the succeeding three intervals, an average of 5.3 mm of mobility was obtained. This resulted in 22.2 +/- 2.3 mm of mobility when each specimen was fully released. These data show that there is no intrinsic muscle fiber length limitation to excursion, but that excursion is limited by other intermuscular connections to adjacent connective tissue and other muscles.},

	abstract = {Biomechanics researchers often use multibody models to represent biological systems. However, the mapping from biology to mechanics and back can be problematic. OpenSim is a popular open source tool used for this purpose, mapping between biological specifications and an underlying generalized coordinate multibody system called Simbody. One quantity of interest to biomechanical researchers and clinicians is “muscle moment arm,” a measure of the effectiveness of a muscle at contributing to a particular motion over a range of configurations. OpenSim can automatically calculate these quantities for any muscle once a model has been built. For simple cases, this calculation is the same as the conventional moment arm calculation in mechanical engineering. But a muscle may span several joints (e.g., wrist, neck, back) and may follow a convoluted path over various curved surfaces. A biological joint may require several bodies or even a mechanism to accurately represent in the multibody model (e.g., knee, shoulder). In these situations we need a careful definition of muscle moment arm that is analogous to the mechanical engineering concept, yet generalized to be of use to biomedical researchers. Here we present some biomechanical modeling challenges and how they are resolved in OpenSim and Simbody to yield biologically meaningful muscle moment arms.},

Consequenly, many theories of motor function are based on the notion of optimal performance: they quantify the task goals, and apply the sophisticated tools of optimal control theory to obtain detailed behavioral predictions. The resulting models, although not without limitations, has explained a wider range of empirical phenomena than any other class of models. Traditional emphasis has been on optimizing average trajectories while ignoring sensory feedback. Recent work has redefined optimality on the level of feedback control laws, and focused on the mechanisms that generate behavior online. This has made it possible to fit a number of previously unrelated concepts and observations into what may become a unified theoretical framework for interpreting motor function. At the heart of the framework is the relationship between high-level goals, and the realtime sensorimotor control strategies most suitable for accomplishing those goals.},

	abstract = {Metabolic energy expenditure (MEE) is a critical performance measure of human motion. In this study, a general joint-space numerical model of MEE is derived by integrating the laws of thermodynamics and principles of multibody system dynamics, which can evaluate MEE without the limitations inherent in experimental measurements (phase delays, steady state and task restrictions, and limited range of motion) or muscle-space models (complexities and indeterminacies from excessive DOFs, contacts and wrapping interactions, and reliance on in vitro parameters). Muscle energetic components are mapped to the joint space, in which the MEE model is formulated. A constrained multi-objective optimization algorithm is established to estimate the model parameters from experimental walking data also used for initial validation. The joint-space parameters estimated directly from active subjects provide reliable MEE estimates with a mean absolute error of 3.6 ± 3.6\% relative to validation values, which can be used to evaluate MEE for complex non-periodic tasks that may not be experimentally verifiable. This model also enables real-time calculations of instantaneous MEE rate as a function of time for transient evaluations. Although experimental measurements may not be completely replaced by model evaluations, predicted quantities can be used as strong complements to increase reliability of the results and yield unique insights for various applications.

However, little is known about the optimal walking speed while carrying a load. In this work, we studied the eﬀect of speed and load on the energy expenditure of walking. The O2 consumption and CO2 production were measured in ten subjects while standing or walking at diﬀerent speeds from 0.5 to 1.7 m sÀ1 with loads from 0 to 75\% of their body mass (Mb). The loads were carried in typical trekker’s backpacks with hip support. Our results show that the massspeciﬁc gross metabolic power increases curvilinearly with speed and is directly proportional to the load at any speed. For all loading conditions, the gross metabolic energy cost (J kgÀ1 mÀ1) presents a U-shaped curve with a minimum at around 1.3 m sÀ1. At that optimal speed, a load up to 1/4 Mb seems appropriate for long-distance walks. In addition, the optimal speed for net cost minimization is around 1.06 m sÀ1 and is independent of load.},

When the response was less vigorous it took longer to move far enough to release a switch or exceed the elasticity of the finger pulp. Although using a micro-switch would have made the reaction time appear to be longer for the constrained movement, reaction times determined in the most reliable ways were not systematically longer for the constrained movement. The most reliable method is to use extrapolation of the change in the average force that the finger exerts on the surface to estimate the reaction time.},

We tested this idea by having subjects making point-to-point movements while grasping a robotic manipulandum. The robot created a force field chosen such that the minimal energy hand path for reaching movements differed substantially from those observed in a null field. The results show that after extended exposure to the force field, subjects continued to move exactly as they did in the null field and thus used substantially more energy than needed. Even after practicing to move along the minimal energy path, subjects did not adapt their freely chosen hand paths to reduce energy expenditure.

	abstract = {1. The contractile properties of human motor units from the first dorsal interosseus muscle of the hand were studied during voluntary isometric contractions using recently developed techniques. 2. The twitch tensions produced by motor units varied widely from about 0·1–10 g. The twitch tension of a motor unit varied nearly linearly as a function of the level of voluntary force at which it was recruited over the entire range of forces studied (0–2 kg). 3. The number of additional motor units recruited during a given increment in force declined sharply at high levels of voluntary force. This suggests that even though the high threshold units generate more tension, the contribution of recruitment to increases in voluntary force declines at higher force levels. 4. Contraction times for these motor units varied from 30 to 100 msec. Over 80\% had contraction times less than 70 msec, and might be classed as fast twitch motor units. The larger motor units, which were recruited at higher threshold forces, tended to have shorter contraction times than the smaller units.},

Existing theories posit that the motor system prepares for all potential goals by generating several motor plans in parallel. One major line of evidence for such theories is that presenting two competing goals often results in a movement intermediate between them. These intermediate movements are thought to reflect an unintentional averaging of the competing plans. However, normative theories suggest instead that intermediate movements might actually be deliberate, generated because they improve task performance over a random guessing strategy. To test this hypothesis, we vary the benefit of making an intermediate movement by changing movement speed. We find that participants generate intermediate movements only at (slower) speeds where they measurably improve performance. Our findings support the normative view that the motor system selects only a single, flexible motor plan, optimized for uncertain goals.},

	abstract = {We sought to understand how leg muscle function determines the metabolic  cost of walking. We first indirectly assessed the metabolic cost of swinging  the legs and then examined the cost of generating muscular force during the  stance phase. Four men and four women walked at 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 m/s  carrying loads equal to 0, 10, 20, and 30\% body mass positioned symmetrically  about the waist. The net metabolic rate increased in nearly direct proportion  to the external mechanical power during moderate-speed (0.5–1.5 m/s)  load carrying, suggesting that the cost of swinging the legs is relatively  small. The active muscle volume required to generate force on the ground and  the rate of generating this force accounted for {\textgreater}85\% of the increase in net  metabolic rate across moderate speeds and most loading conditions. Although  these factors explained less of the increase in metabolic rate between 1.5 and  2.0 m/s (∼50\%), the cost of generating force per unit volume of active  muscle [i.e., the cost coefficient (k)] was similar across all  conditions [k = 0.11 ± 0.03 (SD) J/cm3]. These data  indicate that, regardless of the work muscles do, the metabolic cost of  walking can be largely explained by the cost of generating muscular force  during the stance phase.},

	abstract = {When active muscles are stretched, our understanding of muscle function is stretched as well. Our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of concentric contraction has advanced considerably since the advent of the sliding filament theory, whereas mechanisms for increased force production during eccentric contraction are only now becoming clearer. Eccentric contractions play an important role in everyday human movements, including mobility, stability, and muscle strength. Shortly after the sliding filament theory of muscle contraction was introduced, there was a reluctant recognition that muscle behaved as if it contained an “elastic” filament. Jean Hanson and Hugh Huxley referred to this structure as the “S-filament,” though their concept gained little traction. This additional filament, the giant titin protein, was identified several decades later, and its roles in muscle contraction are still being discovered. Recent research has demonstrated that, like activation of thin filaments by calcium, titin is also activated in muscle sarcomeres by mechanisms only now being elucidated. The mdm mutation in mice appears to prevent activation of titin, and is a promising model system for investigating mechanisms of titin activation. Titin stiffness appears to increase with muscle force production, providing a mechanism that explains two fundamental properties of eccentric contractions: their high force and low energetic cost. The high force and low energy cost of eccentric contractions makes them particularly well suited for athletic training and rehabilitation. Eccentric exercise is commonly prescribed for treatment of a variety of conditions including sarcopenia, osteoporosis, and tendinosis. Use of eccentric exercise in rehabilitation and athletic training has exploded to include treatment for the elderly, as well as muscle and bone density maintenance for astronauts during long-term space travel. For exercise intolerance and many types of sports injuries, experimental evidence suggests that interventions involving eccentric exercise are demonstrably superior to conventional concentric interventions. Future work promises to advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that confer high force and low energy cost to eccentric contraction, as well as signaling mechanisms responsible for the beneficial effects of eccentric exercise in athletic training and rehabilitation.},

	abstract = {The sliding filament and cross-bridge theories of muscle contraction provide discrete predictions of the tetanic force-length relationship of skeletal muscle that have been tested experimentally. The active force generated by a maximally activated single fiber (with sarcomere length control) is maximal when the filament overlap is optimized and is proportionally decreased when overlap is diminished. The force-length relationship is a static property of skeletal muscle and, therefore, it does not predict the consequences of dynamic contractions. Changes in sarcomere length during muscle contraction result in modulation of the active force that is not necessarily predicted by the cross-bridge theory. The results of in vivo studies of the force-length relationship suggest that muscles that operate on the ascending limb of the force-length relationship typically function in stretch-shortening cycle contractions, and muscles that operate on the descending limb typically function in shorten-stretch cycle contractions. The joint moments produced by a muscle depend on the moment arm and the sarcomere length of the muscle. Moment arm magnitude also affects the excursion (length change) of a muscle for a given change in joint angle, and the number of sarcomeres arranged in series within a muscle fiber determines the sarcomere length change associated with a given excursion.},

	abstract = {Muscles produce force and power by utilizing chemical energy through ATP hydrolysis. During concentric contractions (shortening), muscles generate less force compared to isometric contractions, but consume greater amounts of energy as shortening velocity increases. Conversely, more force is generated and less energy is consumed during eccentric muscle contractions (lengthening). This relationship between force, energy use, and the velocity of contraction has important implications for understanding muscle efficiency, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this behavior remain poorly understood. Here we used spatially-explicit, multi-filament models of Ca2+-regulated force production within a half-sarcomere to simulate how force production, energy utilization, and the number of bound cross-bridges are affected by dynamic changes in sarcomere length. These computational simulations show that cross-bridge binding increased during slow-velocity concentric and eccentric contractions, compared to isometric contractions. Over the full ranges of velocities that we simulated, cross-bridge cycling and energy utilization (i.e. ATPase rates) increased during shortening, and decreased during lengthening. These findings are consistent with the Fenn effect, but arise from a complicated relationship between velocity-dependent cross-bridge recruitment and cross-bridge cycling kinetics. We also investigated how force production, power output, and energy utilization varied with cross-bridge and myofilament compliance, which is impossible to address under typical experimental conditions. These important simulations show that increasing cross-bridge compliance resulted in greater cross-bridge binding and ATPase activity, but less force was generated per cross-bridge and throughout the sarcomere. These data indicate that the efficiency of force production decreases in a velocity-dependent manner, and that this behavior is sensitive to cross-bridge compliance. In contrast, significant effects of myofilament compliance on force production were only observed during isometric contractions, suggesting that changes in myofilament compliance may not influence power output during non-isometric contractions as greatly as changes in cross-bridge compliance. These findings advance our understanding of how cross-bridge and myofilament properties underlie velocity-dependent changes in contractile efficiency during muscle movement.},

	abstract = {A simulation based on a forward dynamical musculoskeletal model was computed from an optimal control algorithm to understand uni- and bi-articular muscle coordination of maximum-speed startup pedaling. The muscle excitations, pedal reaction forces, and crank and pedal kinematics of the simulation agreed with measurements from subjects. Over the crank cycle, uniarticular hip and knee extensor muscles provide 55\% of the propulsive energy, even though 27\% of the amount they produce in the downstroke is absorbed in the upstroke. Only 44\% of the energy produced by these muscles during downstroke is delivered to the crank directly. The other 56\% is delivered to the limb segments, and then transfererred to the crank by the ankle plantarflexors. The plantarflexors, especially soleus, also prevent knee hyperextension, by slowing the knee extension being produced during downstroke by the other muscles, including hamstrings. Hamstrings and rectus femoris make smooth pedaling possible by propelling the crank through the stroke transitions. Other simulations showed that pedaling can be performed well by partitioning all the muscles in a leg into two pairs of phase-controlled alternating functional groups, with each group also alternating with its contralateral counterpart. In this scheme, the uniarticular hip/knee extensor muscles (one group) are excited during downstroke, and the uniarticular hip/knee flexor muscles (the alternating group) during upstorke. The ankle dorsiflexor and rectus femoris muscles (one group of the other pair) are excited near the transition from upstroke to downstroke, and the ankle plantarflexors and hamstrings muscles (the alternating group) during the downstroke to upstroke transition. We conclude that these alternating functional muscle groups might represent a centrally generated primitive for not only pedaling but also other locomotor tasks as well.},

	abstract = {Physics-based predictive simulations of human movement have the potential to support personalized medicine, but large computational costs and difficulties to model control strategies have limited their use. We have developed a computationally efficient optimal control framework to predict human gaits based on optimization of a performance criterion without relying on experimental data. The framework generates three-dimensional muscle-driven simulations in 36 min on average—more than 20 times faster than existing simulations—by using direct collocation, implicit differential equations and algorithmic differentiation. Using this framework, we identified a multi-objective performance criterion combining energy and effort considerations that produces physiologically realistic walking gaits. The same criterion also predicted the walk-to-run transition and clinical gait deficiencies caused by muscle weakness and prosthesis use, suggesting that diverse healthy and pathological gaits can emerge from the same control strategy. The ability to predict the mechanics and energetics of a broad range of gaits with complex three-dimensional musculoskeletal models will allow testing novel hypotheses about gait control and hasten the development of optimal treatments for neuro-musculoskeletal disorders.},

Because of the redundancy in the musculoskeletal system, the CNS can choose one of infinitely many possible muscle activation patterns which generate the same force. What strategies and constraints underlie such selection is an open issue. The CNS might optimize a performance criterion, such as accuracy or effort. Moreover, the CNS might simplify the solution by constraining it to be a combination of a few muscle synergies, coordinated recruitment of groups of muscles. We tested whether the CNS generates forces by minimum effort recruitment of either individual muscles or muscle synergies. We compared the activation of arm muscles observed during the generation of isometric forces at the hand across multiple three-dimensional force targets with the activation predicted by either minimizing the sum of squared muscle activations or the sum of squared synergy activations. Muscle synergies were identified from the recorded muscle pattern using non-negative matrix factorization. To perform both optimizations we assumed a linear relationship between rectified and filtered electromyographic (EMG) signal which we estimated using multiple linear regressions. We found that the minimum effort recruitment of synergies predicted the observed muscle patterns better than the minimum effort recruitment of individual muscles. However, both predictions had errors much larger than the reconstruction error obtained by the synergies, suggesting that the CNS generates three-dimensional forces by sub-optimal recruitment of muscle synergies.},

	abstract = {Determining the muscle forces that underlie some experimentally observed human motion, is a challenging biomechanical problem, both from an experimental and a computational point of view. No non-invasive method is currently available for experimentally measuring muscle forces. The alternative of computing them from the observed motion is complicated by the inherent overactuation of the human body: it has many more muscles than strictly needed for driving all the degrees of freedom of the skeleton. As a result, the skeleton’s equations of motion do not suffice to determine the muscle forces unambiguously. Therefore, muscle force determination is often reformulated as a (large-scale) optimization problem. Generally, the optimization approaches are classified according to the formalism, inverse or forward, adopted for solving the skeleton’s equations of motion. Classical inverse approaches are fast but do not take into account the constraints imposed by muscle physiology. Classical forward approaches, on the other hand, do take the muscle physiology into account but are extremely costly from a computational point of view. The present paper makes a double contribution. First, it proposes a novel inverse approach that results from including muscle physiology (both activation and contraction dynamics) in the inverse dynamic formalism. Second, the efficiency with which the corresponding optimization problem is solved is increased by using convex optimization techniques. That is, an approximate convex program is formulated and solved in order to provide a hot-start for the exact nonconvex program. The key element in this approximation is a (global) linearization of muscle physiology based on techniques from experimental system identification. This approach is applied to the study of muscle forces during gait. Although the results for gait are promising, experimental study of faster motions is needed to demonstrate the full power and advantages of the proposed methodology, and therefore is the subject of subsequent research.},

A new, computationally efficient method is proposed that simultaneously achieves the desired trajectory and the dynamically optimized set of muscle stresses, and hence forces, according to the maximal endurance criterion function of Crowninshield and Brand (1981). Muscle-induced accelerations of the system resulting from unit stress contractions of individual muscles are superposed via the new pseudoinverse method to yield the desired motion trajectory. The method is tested on a control problem involving a five degree-of-freedom (DOF), 30 muscle, uppercextremity model, which incorporates a dual rigid-body forearm to represent pronation and supination more adequately. The pseudoinverse method delivered the desired motion to within 0.25° for each DOF-during a three-sceond simulation. It is anticipated that the methodology can be easily and accurately appied to other highly redundant optimal control problems in biomechanics.},

The result is the best possible match between physiologically observed muscle activation patterns and the predicted forces, while satisfying the moment constraints about all three joint axes.

After a review of the properties of muscle and tendon, their integrated ability to generate force statically and dynamically is studied by formulating a generic model of the "musculotendon actuator", which has only one parameter, the ratio of tendon length at rest to muscle fiber length at rest. To illustrate the utility of the model, it is analyzed to show how this one parameter specifies whether excitation-contraction or musculotendon contraction is the rate-limiting process of force generation, whether elastic energy is stored in tendon or muscle, and whether hip- and knee-extensor actuators function as springs or dashpots during walking.},

When the dynamics of muscle activation and contraction are modeled for consistency with muscle physiology, the resulting optimization problem is dynamic and challenging to solve. This study sought to identify a robust and computationally efficient formulation for solving these dynamic optimization problems using direct collocation optimal control methods. Four problem formulations were investigated for walking based on both a two and three dimensional model. Formulations differed in the use of either an explicit or implicit representation of contraction dynamics with either muscle length or tendon force as a state variable. The implicit representations introduced additional controls defined as the time derivatives of the states, allowing the nonlinear equations describing contraction dynamics to be imposed as algebraic path constraints, simplifying their evaluation. Problem formulation affected computational speed and robustness to the initial guess. The formulation that used explicit contraction dynamics with muscle length as a state failed to converge in most cases. In contrast, the two formulations that used implicit contraction dynamics converged to an optimal solution in all cases for all initial guesses, with tendon force as a state generally being the fastest. Future work should focus on comparing the present approach to other approaches for computing muscle forces. The present approach lacks some of the major limitations of established methods such as static optimization and computed muscle control while remaining computationally efficient.},

When a hand is moved to a target, the central nervous system must select one specific trajectory among an infinite number of possible trajectories that lead to the target position. First, we discuss what criterion is adopted for trajectory determination. Several researchers measured the hand trajectories of skilled movements and found common invariant features. For example, when moving the hand between a pair of targets, subjects tended to generate roughly straight hand paths with bell-shaped speed profiles. On the basis of these observations and dynamic optimization theory, we propose a mathematical model which accounts for formation of hand trajectories. This model is formulated by defining an objective function, a measure of performance for any possible movement: square of the rate of change of torque integrated over the entire movement. That is, the objective function CT is defined as follows: (formula; see text) We overcome this difficult by developing an iterative scheme, with which the optimal trajectory and the associated motor command are simultaneously computed. To evaluate our model, human hand trajectories were experimentally measured under various behavioral situations. These results supported the idea that the human hand trajectory is planned and controlled in accordance with the minimum torque-change criterion.},

Here, we argue that the most intuitive and epistemologically valuable treatment is in terms of effort-based decision-making, and advocate a neuroeconomics-focused research strategy. We first outline psychological and neuroscientific theories of cognitive effort. Then we describe the benefits of a neuroeconomic research strategy, highlighting how it affords greater inferential traction than do traditional markers of cognitive effort, including self-reports and physiologic markers of autonomic arousal. Finally, we sketch a future series of studies that can leverage the full potential of the neuroeconomic approach toward understanding the cognitive and neural mechanisms that give rise to phenomenal, subjective cognitive effort.},

	abstract = {This paper presents studies of the coordination of voluntary human arm movements. A mathematical model is formulated which is shown to predict both the qualitative features and the quantitative details observed experimentally in planar, multijoint arm movements. Coordination is modeled mathematically by defining an objective function, a measure of performance for any possible movement. The unique trajectory which yields the best performance is determined using dynamic optimization theory. In the work presented here, the objective function is the square of the magnitude of jerk (rate of change of acceleration) of the hand integrated over the entire movement. This is equivalent to assuming that a major goal of motor coordination is the production of the smoothest possible movement of the hand. Experimental observations of human subjects performing voluntary unconstrained movements in a horizontal plane are presented. They confirm the following predictions of the mathematical model: unconstrained point-to-point motions are approximately straight with bell-shaped tangential velocity profiles; curved motions (through an intermediate point or around an obstacle) have portions of low curvature joined by portions of high curvature; at points of high curvature, the tangential velocity is reduced; the durations of the low-curvature portions are approximately equal. The theoretical analysis is based solely on the kinematics of movement independent of the dynamics of the musculoskeletal system and is successful only when formulated in terms of the motion of the hand in extracorporal space. The implications with respect to movement organization are discussed.},

Variants of this question have preoccupied researchers in a wide range of domains, from mainstream experimental psychology (cognition, perception, social behavior) to cognitive neuroscience and behavioral economics. A pervasive view places a heavy explanatory burden on an intelligent cognitive unconscious, with many theories assigning causally effective roles to unconscious influences. This article presents a novel framework for evaluating these claims and reviews evidence from three major bodies of research in which unconscious factors have been studied: multiple-cue judgment, deliberation without attention, and decisions under uncertainty. Studies of priming (subliminal and primes-to-behavior) and the role of awareness in movement and perception (e.g., timing of willed actions, blindsight) are also given brief consideration. The review highlights that inadequate procedures for assessing awareness, failures to consider artifactual explanations of "landmark" results, and a tendency to uncritically accept conclusions that fit with our intuitions have all contributed to unconscious influences being ascribed inflated and erroneous explanatory power in theories of decision making. The review concludes by recommending that future research should focus on tasks in which participants' attention is diverted away from the experimenter's hypothesis, rather than the highly reflective tasks that are currently often employed.},

The motor cortex is traditionally viewed as the final output stage in this process, merely executing motor responses based on these decisions. However, it is not clear if, beyond this role, the motor cortex itself impacts response selection. Here, we report activity fluctuations over motor cortex measured using MEG, which are unrelated to choice content and predict responses to a visuomotor task seconds before decisions are made. These fluctuations are strongly influenced by the previous trial's response and predict a tendency to switch between response alternatives for consecutive decisions. This alternation behaviour depends on the size of neural signals still present from the previous response. Our results uncover a response-alternation bias in sensorimotor decision making. Furthermore, they suggest that motor cortex is more than an output stage and instead shapes response selection during sensorimotor decision making.},

	abstract = {Optimality criteria underlying organization of arm movements are often validated by testing their ability to adequately predict hand trajectories. However, kinematic redundancy of the arm allows production of the same hand trajectory through different joint coordination patterns. We therefore consider movement optimality at the level of joint coordination patterns. A review of studies of multi-joint movement control suggests that a ‘trailing’ pattern of joint control is consistently observed during which a single (‘leading’) joint is rotated actively and interaction torque produced by this joint is the primary contributor to the motion of the other (‘trailing’) joints. A tendency to use the trailing pattern whenever the kinematic redundancy is sufficient and increased utilization of this pattern during skillful movements suggests optimality of the trailing pattern. The goal of this study is to determine the cost function minimization of which predicts the trailing pattern. We show that extensive experimental testing of many known cost functions cannot successfully explain optimality of the trailing pattern. We therefore propose a novel cost function that represents neural effort for joint coordination. That effort is quantified as the cost of neural information processing required for joint coordination. We show that a tendency to reduce this ‘neurocomputational’ cost predicts the trailing pattern and that the theoretically developed predictions fully agree with the experimental findings on control of multi-joint movements. Implications for future research of the suggested interpretation of the trailing joint control pattern and the theory of joint coordination underlying it are discussed.},

The most basic and frequent decisions we make occur as our motor system chooses and executes only those actions that achieve our current goals. Although these interactions with the environment may appear effortless, this belies what must be incredibly sophisticated visuomotor decision-making processes. In order to measure how visuomotor decisions unfold in real-time, we used a unique reaching paradigm that forced participants to initiate rapid hand movements toward multiple potential targets, with only one being cued after reach onset. We show across three experiments that, in cases of target uncertainty, trajectories are spatially sensitive to the probabilistic distribution of targets within the display. Specifically, when presented with two or three target displays, subjects initiate their reaches toward an intermediary or ‘averaged’ location before correcting their trajectory in-flight to the cued target location. A control experiment suggests that our effect depends on the targets acting as potential reach locations and not as distractors. This study is the first to show that the ‘averaging’ of target-directed reaching movements depends not only on the spatial position of the targets in the display but also the probability of acting at each target location.},

To identify whether the brain uses kinematic, dynamic and energetic values in an isolated manner or combines them in a flexible way, we examined the effects of speed variations upon the chosen arm trajectories during free arm movements. Within the optimal control framework, we uncovered which (possibly composite) optimality criterion underlays at best the empirical data. Fifteen participants were asked to perform free-endpoint reaching movements from a specific arm configuration at slow, normal and fast speeds. Experimental results revealed that prominent features of observed motor behaviors were significantly speed-dependent, such as the chosen reach endpoint and the final arm posture. Nevertheless, participants exhibited different arm trajectories and various degrees of speed dependence of their reaching behavior. These inter-individual differences were addressed using a numerical inverse optimal control methodology. Simulation results revealed that a weighted combination of kinematic, energetic and dynamic cost functions was required to account for all the critical features of the participants’ behavior. Furthermore, no evidence for the existence of a speed-dependent tuning of these weights was found, thereby suggesting subject-specific but speed-invariant weightings of kinematic, energetic and dynamic variables during the motor planning process of free arm movements. This suggested that the inter-individual difference of arm trajectories and speed dependence was not only due to anthropometric singularities but also to critical differences in the composition of the subjective cost function.},

The resulting changes in the world act to generate sensations that feed back to the nervous system, closing the control loop.

	abstract = {Quantitative examinations of internal representations for arm trajectory planning: minimum commanded torque change model. A number of invariant features of multijoint planar reaching movements have been observed in measured hand trajectories. These features include roughly straight hand paths and bell-shaped speed profiles where the trajectory curvatures between transverse and radial movements have been found to be different. For quantitative and statistical investigations, we obtained a large amount of trajectory data within a wide range of the workspace in the horizontal and sagittal planes (400 trajectories for each subject). A pair of movements within the horizontal and sagittal planes was set to be equivalent in the elbow and shoulder flexion/extension. The trajectory curvatures of the corresponding pair in these planes were almost the same. Moreover, these curvatures can be accurately reproduced with a linear regression from the summation of rotations in the elbow and shoulder joints. This means that trajectory curvatures systematically depend on the movement location and direction represented in the intrinsic body coordinates. We then examined the following four candidates as planning spaces and the four corresponding computational models for trajectory planning. The candidates were as follows: the minimum hand jerk model in an extrinsic-kinematic space, the minimum angle jerk model in an intrinsic-kinematic space, the minimum torque change model in an intrinsic-dynamic-mechanical space, and the minimum commanded torque change model in an intrinsic-dynamic-neural space. The minimum commanded torque change model, which is proposed here as a computable version of the minimum motor command change model, reproduced actual trajectories best for curvature, position, velocity, acceleration, and torque. The model’s prediction that the longer the duration of the movement the larger the trajectory curvature was also confirmed. Movements passing through via-points in the horizontal plane were also measured, and they converged to those predicted by the minimum commanded torque change model with training. Our results indicated that the brain may plan, and learn to plan, the optimal trajectory in the intrinsic coordinates considering arm and muscle dynamics and using representations for motor commands controlling muscle tensions.},

	abstract = {We investigated how the CNS learns to control movements in different dynamical conditions, and how this learned behavior is represented. In particular, we considered the task of making reaching movements in the presence of externally imposed forces from a mechanical environment. This environment was a force field produced by a robot manipulandum, and the subjects made reaching movements while holding the end-effector of this manipulandum. Since the force field significantly changed the dynamics of the task, subjects' initial movements in the force field were grossly distorted compared to their movements in free space. However, with practice, hand trajectories in the force field converged to a path very similar to that observed in free space. This indicated that for reaching movements, there was a kinematic plan independent of dynamical conditions. The recovery of performance within the changed mechanical environment is motor adaptation. In order to investigate the mechanism underlying this adaptation, we considered the response to the sudden removal of the field after a training phase. The resulting trajectories, named aftereffects, were approximately mirror images of those that were observed when the subjects were initially exposed to the field. This suggested that the motor controller was gradually composing a model of the force field, a model that the nervous system used to predict and compensate for the forces imposed by the environment. In order to explore the structure of the model, we investigated whether adaptation to a force field, as presented in a small region, led to aftereffects in other regions of the workspace. We found that indeed there were aftereffects in workspace regions where no exposure to the field had taken place; that is, there was transfer beyond the boundary of the training data. This observation rules out the hypothesis that the subject's model of the force field was constructed as a narrow association between visited states and experienced forces; that is, adaptation was not via composition of a look-up table. In contrast, subjects modeled the force field by a combination of computational elements whose output was broadly tuned across the motor state space. These elements formed a model that extrapolated to outside the training region in a coordinate system similar to that of the joints and muscles rather than end-point forces. This geometric property suggests that the elements of the adaptive process represent dynamics of a motor task in terms of the intrinsic coordinate system of the sensors and actuators.},

	abstract = {* Neuroscientists often suggest that we adapt our movements to minimize energy use; however, recent studies have provided conflicting evidence in this regard. * In the present study, we show that motor learning robustly increases the economy of locomotion during split-belt treadmill adaptation. * We also demonstrate that reductions in metabolic power scale with the magnitude of adaptation and are also associated with a reduction in muscle activity throughout the lower limbs. * Our results provide strong evidence that increasing economy may be a key criterion driving the systematic changes in co-ordination during locomotor adaptation. * These findings may also facilitate the design of novel interventions to improve locomotor learning in stroke survivors. Abstract Many theories of motor control suggest that we select our movements to reduce energy use. However, it is unclear whether this process underlies short-term motor adaptation to novel environments. Here we asked whether adaptation to walking on a split-belt treadmill leads to a more economical walking pattern. We hypothesized that adaptation would be accompanied by a reduction in metabolic power and muscle activity and that these reductions would be temporally correlated. Eleven individuals performed a split-belt adaptation task where the belt speeds were set at 0.5 and 1.5 m s-1. Adaptation was characterized by step length symmetry, which is the normalized difference in step length between the legs. Metabolic power was calculated based on expired gas analysis, and surface EMG was used to record the activity of four bilateral leg muscles (tibialis anterior, lateral gastrocnemius, vastus lateralis and biceps femoris). All participants initially walked with unequal step lengths when the belts moved at different speeds, but gradually adapted to take steps of equal length. Additionally, net metabolic power was reduced from early adaptation to late adaptation (early, 3.78 ± 1.05 W kg−1; and late, 3.05 ± 0.79 W kg−1; P {\textbackslash}textless 0.001). This reduction in power was also accompanied by a bilateral reduction in EMG throughout the gait cycle. Furthermore, the reductions in metabolic power occurred over the same time scale as the improvements in step length symmetry, and the magnitude of these improvements predicted the size of the reduction in metabolic power. Our results suggest that increasing economy may be a key criterion driving locomotor adaptation.},

	abstract = {Initiating a movement in response to a visual stimulus takes significantly longer than might be expected on the basis of neural transmission delays, but it is unclear why. In a visually guided reaching task, we forced human participants to move at lower-than-normal reaction times to test whether normal reaction times are strictly necessary for accurate movement. We found that participants were, in fact, capable of moving accurately ∼80 ms earlier than their reaction times would suggest. Reaction times thus include a seemingly unnecessary delay that accounts for approximately one-third of their duration. Close examination of participants' behavior in conventional reaction-time conditions revealed that they generated occasional, spontaneous errors in trials in which their reaction time was unusually short. The pattern of these errors could be well accounted for by a simple model in which the timing of movement initiation is independent of the timing of movement preparation. This independence provides an explanation for why reaction times are usually so sluggish: delaying the mean time of movement initiation relative to preparation reduces the risk that a movement will be initiated before it has been appropriately prepared. Our results suggest that preparation and initiation of movement are mechanistically independent and may have a distinct neural basis. The results also demonstrate that, even in strongly stimulus-driven tasks, presentation of a stimulus does not directly trigger a movement. Rather, the stimulus appears to trigger an internal decision whether to make a movement, reflecting a volitional rather than reactive mode of control. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The reaction time, i.e., how quickly we can initiate a movement in response to a stimulus, is important for daily activities such as driving and is also a critical tool in neuroscience, used to probe a multitude of cognitive functions. However, there remains a surprising lack of basic understanding about exactly what determines reaction times, even for simple movements such as reaching to a target. We show that the reaction time for a reaching movement does not reflect the moment that the movement becomes ready to execute. Instead, the reaction time is determined by a separate initiation process. These findings suggest a distinct neural basis for preparation and initiation of movement and provide an explanation for the sluggishness of typical reaction times.},

	abstract = {The nervous system controls the behavior of complex kinematically redundant biomechanical systems. How it computes appropriate commands to generate movements is unknown. Here we propose a model based on the assumption that the nervous system: 1) processes static (e.g., gravitational) and dynamic (e.g., inertial) forces separately; 2) calculates appropriate dynamic controls to master the dynamic forces and progress toward the goal according to principles of optimal feedback control; 3) uses the size of the dynamic commands (effort) as an optimality criterion; and 4) can specify movement duration from a given level of effort. The model was used to control kinematic chains with 2, 4, and 7 degrees of freedom [planar shoulder/elbow, three-dimensional (3D) shoulder/elbow, 3D shoulder/elbow/wrist] actuated by pairs of antagonist muscles. The muscles were modeled as second-order nonlinear filters and received the dynamics commands as inputs. Simulations showed that the model can quantitatively reproduce characteristic features of pointing and grasping movements in 3D space, i.e., trajectory, velocity profile, and final posture. Furthermore, it accounted for amplitude/duration scaling and kinematic invariance for distance and load. These results suggest that motor control could be explained in terms of a limited set of computational principles.},

	abstract = {In primates, it is well known that there is a consistent relationship between the duration, peak velocity and amplitude of saccadic eye movements, known as the ‘main sequence’. The reason why such a stereotyped relationship evolved is unknown. We propose that a fundamental constraint on the deployment of foveal vision lies in the motor system that is perturbed by signal-dependent noise (proportional noise) on the motor command. This noise imposes a compromise between the speed and accuracy of an eye movement. We propose that saccade trajectories have evolved to optimize a trade-off between the accuracy and duration of the movement. Taking a semi-analytical approach we use Pontryagin’s minimum principle to show that there is an optimal trajectory for a given amplitude and duration; and that there is an optimal duration for a given amplitude. It follows that the peak velocity is also fixed for a given amplitude. These predictions are in good agreement with observed saccade trajectories and the main sequence. Moreover, this model predicts a small saccadic dead-zone in which it is better to stay eccentric of target than make a saccade onto target. We conclude that the main sequence has evolved as a strategy to optimize the trade-off between accuracy and speed.},

The analytical model is developed by modifying a human muscle expenditure model, in which the muscles are grouped as torque providers for computation efficiency. In the musculoskeletal model, the predication of metabolic cost is conducted on the basis of individual muscles. With the proposed approach, metabolic costs for parameterized target-reaching arm motions are calculated and utilized to identify optimal arm trajectories.},

	abstract = {Simple optimization models show that bipedal locomotion may largely be governed by the mechanical work performed by the legs, minimization of which can automatically discover walking and running gaits. Work minimization can reproduce broad aspects of human ground reaction forces, such as a double-peaked profile for walking and a single peak for running, but the predicted peaks are unrealistically high and impulsive compared to the much smoother forces produced by humans. The smoothness might be explained better by a cost for the force rather than work produced by the legs, but it is unclear what features of force might be most relevant. We therefore tested a generalized force cost that can penalize force amplitude or its n-th time derivative, raised to the p-th power (or p-norm), across a variety of combinations for n and p. A simple model shows that this generalized force cost only produces smoother, human-like forces if it penalizes the rate rather than amplitude of force production, and only in combination with a work cost. Such a combined objective reproduces the characteristic profiles of human walking (R2 = 0.96) and running (R2 = 0.92), more so than minimization of either work or force amplitude alone (R2 = −0.79 and R2 = 0.22, respectively, for walking). Humans might find it preferable to avoid rapid force production, which may be mechanically and physiologically costly.},

Optimal fascicle length, physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA), moment arm, operating range on the force–length curve, and moment-generating capacity were estimated from these data. Brachioradialis and pronator teres had the longest (17.7cm) and shortest (5.5cm) fascicles, respectively. Triceps brachii (combined heads) and brachioradialis had the greatest (14.9cm2) and smallest (1.2cm2) PCSAs, respectively. Despite a comparable fascicle length, long head of biceps brachii operates over a broader range of the force–length curve (length change=56\% of optimal length, 12.8cm) than the long head of triceps brachii (length change=28\% of optimal length, 12.7cm) because of its larger moment arm (4.7cm vs. 2.3cm). Although brachioradialis has a small PCSA, it has a relatively large moment-generating capacity (6.8cm3) due to its large moment arm (average peak=7.7cm).

While the relative sizes of muscles at a single upper limb joint have been established in cadaveric specimens, the relative sizes of muscles across upper limb joints in living subjects remain unclear. We used magnetic resonance imaging to measure the volumes of the 32 upper limb muscles crossing the glenohumeral joint, elbow, forearm, and wrist in 10 young, healthy subjects, ranging from a 20th percentile female to a 97th percentile male, based on height. We measured the volume and volume fraction of these muscles. Muscles crossing the shoulder, elbow, and wrist comprised 52.5, 31.4, and 16.0\% of the total muscle volume, respectively. The deltoid had the largest volume fraction (15.2\%±1\%) and the extensor indicis propius had the smallest (0.2\%±0.05\%). We determined that the distribution of muscle volume in the upper limb is highly conserved across these subjects with a three-fold variation in total muscle volumes (1427–4426cm3). When we predicted the volume of an individual muscle from the mean volume fraction, on average 85\% of the variation among subjects was accounted for (average p=0.0008). This study provides normative data that forms the basis for investigating muscle volumes in other populations, and for scaling computer models to more accurately represent the muscle volume of a specific individual.},

Maximum isometric joint moment, a standard measurement of strength, has typically been assessed in young, healthy subjects, whereas muscle volumes have generally been measured in cadavers. This has made it difficult to characterize the relationship between isometric strength and muscle size in humans. We measured maximum isometric moments about the shoulder, elbow, and wrist in 10 young, healthy subjects, ranging in size from a 20th percentile female to a 97th percentile male. The volumes of 32 upper limb muscles were determined from magnetic resonance images of these same subjects, and grouped according to their primary function. The maximum moments produced using the shoulder adductors (67.9±28.4Nm) were largest, and were approximately 6.5(±1.2) times greater than those produced using the wrist extensors (10.2±4.6Nm), which were smallest. While there were substantial differences in moment-generating capacity among these 10 subjects, moment significantly covaried with muscle volume of the appropriate functional group, explaining between 95\% (p{\textbackslash}textless0.0001; shoulder adductors) and 68\% (p=0.004; wrist flexors) of the variation in the maximum isometric joint moments among subjects. While other factors, such as muscle moment arms or neural activation and coordination, can contribute to variation in strength among subjects, they either were relatively constant across these subjects compared to large differences in muscle volumes or they covaried with muscle volume. We conclude that differences in strength among healthy young adults are primarily a consequence of variation in muscle volume, as opposed to other factors.},

	abstract = {It is well documented that muscle fibers become more sensitive for [Ca2+] with increasing sarcomere length. In mechanical terms this length-dependent [Ca2+] sensitivity (LDCS) adds to the stiffness of muscle fibers, because muscle force, normalized for the force–length relationship at maximal stimulation, increases with contractile element (CE) length. Although LDCS is well-documented in the physiological literature, it is ignored in most motor control studies. The aim of the present study was to investigate the importance of LDCS as a contributor to the stiffness of a muscle. Comparison of experimental data with predictions derived from the model of activation dynamics proposed by Hatze (Myocybernetic Control Models of Skeletal Muscle, University of South Africa, Pretoria, 1981, pp. 31–42) indicated that this model captures the main characteristics of LDCS well. It was shown that LDCS accounts for the experimentally observed shifts in optimum length at sub-maximal stimulation levels. Furthermore, it was shown that in conditions with low-to-medium muscle stimulation, the contribution of LDCS to the total amount of stiffness provided by the muscle is substantial. It was concluded that LDCS is an important muscle property and should be taken into account in studies concerning motor control.},

	abstract = {Skip to Next Section The goal of this study was to gain insight into how ankle exoskeletons affect the behavior of the plantarflexor muscles during walking. Using data from previous experiments, we performed electromyography-driven simulations of musculoskeletal dynamics to explore how changes in exoskeleton assistance affected plantarflexor muscle–tendon mechanics, particularly for the soleus. We used a model of muscle energy consumption to estimate individual muscle metabolic rate. As average exoskeleton torque was increased, while no net exoskeleton work was provided, a reduction in tendon recoil led to an increase in positive mechanical work performed by the soleus muscle fibers. As net exoskeleton work was increased, both soleus muscle fiber force and positive mechanical work decreased. Trends in the sum of the metabolic rates of the simulated muscles correlated well with trends in experimentally observed whole-body metabolic rate (R2=0.9), providing confidence in our model estimates. Our simulation results suggest that different exoskeleton behaviors can alter the functioning of the muscles and tendons acting at the assisted joint. Furthermore, our results support the idea that the series tendon helps reduce positive work done by the muscle fibers by storing and returning energy elastically. We expect the results from this study to promote the use of electromyography-driven simulations to gain insight into the operation of muscle–tendon units and to guide the design and control of assistive devices.},

Therefore, measurements of heat production and mechanical work provide the framework for understanding the process of energy conversion in contraction. In the 1970s, precise comparison between energy output and the associated chemical reactions was performed. It has been found that the two do not match in several situations, resulting in an energy balance discrepancy. More recently, efforts in resolving these discrepancies in the energy balance have been made involving chemical analysis, phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and microcalorimetry. Through reviewing the evidence from these studies, the energy balance discrepancy developed early during isometric contraction has become well understood on a quantitative basis. In this situation energy balance is established when we take into account the binding of Ca to sarcoplasmic proteins such as troponin and parvalbumin, and also the shift of cross-bridge states. On the other hand, the energy balance discrepancy observed during rapid shortening still remains to be clarified. The problem may be related to the essential mechanism of cross-bridge action.},

	abstract = {Muscles exhibit highly complex, multi-scale architecture with thousands of muscle fibers, each with different properties, interacting with each other and surrounding connective structures. Consequently, the results of single-fiber experiments are scarcely linked to the macroscopic or whole muscle behavior. This is especially true for human muscles where it would be important to understand of how skeletal muscles disorders affect patients’ life. In this work, we developed a mathematical model to study how fast and slow muscle fibers, well characterized in single-fiber experiments, work and generate together force and displacement in muscle bundles. We characterized the parameters of a Hill-type model, using experimental data on fast and slow single human muscle fibers, and comparing experimental data with numerical simulations obtained from finite element (FE) models of single fibers. Then, we developed a FE model of a bundle of 19 fibers, based on an immunohistochemically stained cross section of human diaphragm and including the corresponding properties of each slow or fast fiber. Simulations of isotonic contractions of the bundle model allowed the generation of its apparent force–velocity relationship. Although close to the average of the force–velocity curves of fast and slow fibers, the bundle curve deviates substantially toward the fast fibers at low loads. We believe that the present model and the characterization of the force–velocity curve of a fiber bundle represents the starting point to link the single-fiber properties to those of whole muscle with FE application in phenomenological models of human muscles.},

However, the underlying work mechanism of the cerebral cortex in adaptive motor control still remains unclear. How does the cerebral cortex organize and coordinate the activity of a large population of cells in the implementation of various motor strategies? To explore this issue, single-unit activities from the M1 region and kinematic data were recorded simultaneously in monkeys performing 3D reach-to-grasp tasks with different perturbations. Varying motor control strategies were employed and achieved in different perturbed tasks, via the dynamic allocation of cells to modulate specific movement parameters. An economic principle was proposed for the first time to describe a basic rule for cell allocation in the primary motor cortex. This principle, defined as the Dynamic Economic Cell Allocation Mechanism (DECAM), guarantees benefit maximization in cell allocation under limited neuronal resources, and avoids committing resources to uneconomic investments for unreliable factors with no or little revenue. That is to say, the cells recruited are always preferentially allocated to those factors with reliable return; otherwise, the cells are dispatched to respond to other factors about task. The findings of this study might partially reveal the working mechanisms underlying the role of the cerebral cortex in adaptive motor control, wherein is also of significance for the design of future intelligent brain-machine interfaces and rehabilitation device.},

	abstract = {Motor actions may result from central changes in the referent body configuration, defined as the body posture at which muscles begin to be activated or deactivated. The actual body configuration deviates from the referent configuration, particularly because of body inertia and environmental forces. Within these constraints, the system tends to minimize the difference between these configurations. For pointing movement, this strategy can be expressed as the tendency to minimize the difference between the referent trajectory (RT) and actual trajectory (QT) of the effector (hand). This process may underlie motor equivalent behavior that maintains the pointing trajectory regardless of the number of body segments involved. We tested the hypothesis that the minimization process is used to produce pointing in standing subjects. With eyes closed, 10 subjects reached from a standing position to a remembered target located beyond arm length. In randomly chosen trials, hip flexion was unexpectedly prevented, forcing subjects to take a step during pointing to prevent falling. The task was repeated when subjects were instructed to intentionally take a step during pointing. In most cases, reaching accuracy and trajectory curvature were preserved due to adaptive condition-specific changes in interjoint coordination. Results suggest that referent control and the minimization process associated with it may underlie motor equivalence in pointing. NEW \& NOTEWORTHY Motor actions may result from minimization of the deflection of the actual body configuration from the centrally specified referent body configuration, in the limits of neuromuscular and environmental constraints. The minimization process may maintain reaching trajectory and accuracy regardless of the number of body segments involved (motor equivalence), as confirmed in this study of reaching from standing in young healthy individuals.

	abstract = {Strategies used by the CNS to optimize arm movements in terms of speed, accuracy, and resistance to fatigue remain largely unknown. A hypothesis is studied that the CNS exploits biomechanical properties of multijoint limbs to increase efficiency of movement control. To test this notion, a novel free-stroke drawing task was used that instructs subjects to make straight strokes in as many different directions as possible in the horizontal plane through rotations of the elbow and shoulder joints. Despite explicit instructions to distribute strokes uniformly, subjects showed biases to move in specific directions. These biases were associated with a tendency to perform movements that included active motion at one joint and largely passive motion at the other joint, revealing a tendency to minimize intervention of muscle torque for regulation of the effect of interaction torque. Other biomechanical factors, such as inertial resistance and kinematic manipulability, were unable to adequately account for these significant biases. Also, minimizations of jerk, muscle torque change, and sum of squared muscle torque were analyzed; however, these cost functions failed to explain the observed directional biases. Collectively, these results suggest that knowledge of biomechanical cost functions regarding interaction torque (IT) regulation is available to the control system. This knowledge may be used to evaluate potential movements and to select movement of “low cost.” The preference to reduce active regulation of interaction torque suggests that, in addition to muscle energy, the criterion for movement cost may include neural activity required for movement control.},

	abstract = {A dynamical model of the neuro-musculo-skeletal mechanics of a cat hindlimb is developed to investigate the feedback regulation of standing posture under small perturbations. The model is a three-joint limb, moving only in the sagittal plane, driven by 10 musculotendon actuators, each with response dynamics dependent on activation kinetics and muscle kinematics. Under small perturbations, the nonlinear postural regulation mechanism is approximately linear. Sensors exist which could provide state feedback. Thus, the linear quadratic regulator is proposed as a model for the structure of the feedback controller for regulation of small perturbations. System states are chosen to correspond to the known outputs of physiological sensors: muscle forces (sensed by tendon organs), a combination of muscle lengths and velocities (sensed by spindle organs), joint angles and velocities (sensed by joint receptors), and motoneuron activities (sensed by Renshaw cells). Thus, the feedback gain matrices computed can be related to the spinal neural circuits. Several proposals for control strategy have been tested under this formulation. It is shown that a strategy of regulating all the states leads to controllers that best mimic the externally measured behavior of real cats},

This suggests that reward and effort not only affect decision-making, they also influence motor control [ 6, 7 ]. How does the brain compute the effort requirements of a task? Here, we considered data acquired during walking, reaching, flying, or isometric force production. In analyzing the decision-making and motor-control behaviors of various animals, we considered the possibility that the brain may estimate effort objectively, via the metabolic energy consumed to produce the action. We measured the energetic cost of reaching and found that, like walking, it was convex in time, with a global minimum, implying that there existed a movement speed that minimized effort. However, reward made it worthwhile to be energetically inefficient. Using a framework in which utility of an action depended on reward and energetic cost, both discounted in time, we found that it was possible to account for a body of data in which animals were free to choose how to move (reach slow or fast), as well as what to do (walk or fly, produce force F1 or F2). We suggest that some forms of decision-making and motor control may share a common utility in which the brain represents the effort associated with performing an action objectively via its metabolic energy cost and then, like reward, temporally discounts it as a function of movement duration.},

The aim of the model is to estimate or predict muscle forces about a joint, which can be used to estimate the corresponding joint compressive forces, and/or ligament forces in healthy and impaired subjects, based on the way they activate their muscles. Methods: The estimation of joint moments requires three steps. In the first step, muscle activation dynamics govern the transformation from the EMG signal to a measure of muscle activation—a time-varying parameter between 0 and 1. In the second step, muscle contraction dynamics characterize how muscle activations are transformed into muscle forces. The final step requires a model of the musculoskeletal geometry to transform muscle forces to joint moments. Each of these steps involves complex, nonlinear relationships. Results: An application is provided to demonstrate how this model can be used to study the forces in the healthy ankle during dynamometer trials and during gait. The model-predicted estimates of joint moment were found to match experimentally determined values closely. Conclusion: Neuromusculoskeletal models that use EMG as inputs can be employed to accurately estimate joint moments. The muscle forces predicted from these models can be used to better understand tissue loading in joints, and to provide in vivo estimates of tensile ligament forces and compressive cartilage loads during dynamic tasks. This tool has great potential for aiding in the study of injury mechanisms in sports.},

	abstract = {Previous musculoskeletal modeling studies have adopted the assumption of the same maximum isometric muscle stress among the prime elbow flexors. This study aimed at estimating the maximum isometric muscle stress based on subject-specific modeling parameters measured in vivo and validating that assumption. Subject-specific musculoskeletal models of the upper limbs of five normal subjects were developed, which incorporated anthropometrically scaled graphics-based geometrical models and Hill-type musculotendon models of the prime elbow flexors. B-mode ultrasound technique was employed to measure the muscle optimal length and pennation angle of each prime elbow flexor, and these architectural parameters were inputted into the model to reduce the number of unknown parameters to be optimized. To allow changes of individual maximum isometric muscle force of the prime elbow flexors, optimizations were conducted by minimizing the root mean square difference between the predicted and measured isometric torque–angle curves. Maximum isometric muscle stress of each prime elbow flexor was estimated by dividing the maximum isometric muscle force with the corresponding physiological cross-sectional area. Our findings showed that maximum isometric muscle stress among the prime elbow flexors was not significantly different from each other. Thus it appears that it is reasonable to assume the same value for maximum isometric muscle stress for all prime elbow flexors in musculoskeletal modeling studies. Latest medical imaging techniques such as ultrasound for the estimation of musculotendon parameters would provide an alterative method to obtain the muscle architecture parameters noninvasively. The subject-specific musculotendon parameters estimated in this study could be used for developing the neuromusculoskeletal model to predict muscle force and evaluate muscle functions.},

	abstract = {It is often assumed that moment arms scale with size and can be normalized by body segment lengths or limb circumferences. However, quantitative scaling relationships between moment arms and anthropometric dimensions are generally not available. We hypothesized that peak moment arms of the elbow flexor and extensor muscles scale with the shorter distance (Ds) between the elbow flexion axis and a muscle's origin and insertion. To test this hypothesis, we estimated moment arms of six muscles that cross the elbow, digitized muscle attachment sites and bone surface geometry, and estimated the location of the elbow flexion axis in 10 upper extremity cadaveric specimens which ranged in size from a 5′0″ female to a 6′4″ male. Ds accurately reflected the differences in peak moment arms across different muscles, explaining 93–99\% of the variation in peaks between muscles in the same specimen. Ds also explained between 55\% and 88\% of the interspecimen variation in peak moment arms for brachioradialis, biceps, and ECRL. Triceps peak moment arm was significantly correlated to the anterior–posterior dimension of the ulna measured at the olecranon (r2=0.61, p=0.008). Radius length provides a good measure of the interspecimen variation in peaks for brachioradialis, biceps, and ECRL. However, bone lengths were not significantly correlated to triceps moment arm or anterior–posterior bone dimensions. This work advances our understanding of the variability and scaling dimensions for elbow muscle moment arms across subjects of different sizes.},

To be broadly applicable, a model must be accessible to users, provide accurate representations of muscles and joints, and capture important interactions between joints. We have developed a model of the upper extremity that includes 15 degrees of freedom representing the shoulder, elbow, forearm, wrist, thumb, and index finger, and 50 muscle compartments crossing these joints. The kinematics of each joint and the force-generating parameters for each muscle were derived from experimental data. The model estimates the muscle–tendon lengths and moment arms for each of the muscles over a wide range of postures. Given a pattern of muscle activations, the model also estimates muscle forces and joint moments. The moment arms and maximum moment-generating capacity of each muscle group (e.g., elbow flexors) were compared to experimental data to assess the accuracy of the model. These comparisons showed that moment arms and joint moments estimated using the model captured important features of upper extremity geometry and mechanics. The model also revealed coupling between joints, such as increased passive finger flexion moment with wrist extension. The computer model is available to researchers at http://nmbl.stanford.edu.},

One model of EP control, the α-model, posits that stable EPs and stiffness are set open-loop, i.e. without the aid of feedback. The purpose of the present study was to explore for the elbow joint the range over which stable EPs can be set open-loop and to investigate the effect of co-contraction on intrinsic low-frequency elbow joint stiffness (Kilf). For this purpose, a model of the upper and lower arm was constructed, equipped with Hill-type muscles. At a constant neural input, the isometric force of the contractile element of the muscles depended on both the myofilamentary overlap and the effect of sarcomere length on the sensitivity of myofilaments to [Ca2+] (LDCS). The musculoskeletal model, for which the parameters were chosen carefully on the basis of physiological literature, captured the salient isometric properties of the muscles spanning the elbow joint. It was found that stable open-loop EPs could be achieved over the whole range of motion of the elbow joint and that Kilf, which ranged from 18 to 42 N m·rad−1, could be independently controlled. In the model, LDCS contributed substantially to Kilf (up to 25 N m·rad−1) and caused Kilf to peak at a sub-maximal level of co-contraction.},

A model for each actuator was formulated to compute its isometric force-length relation. The kinematics of the lower extremity were defined by modeling the hip, knee, ankle, subtalar, and metatarsophalangeal joints. Thus, the force and joint moment that each musculotendon actuator develops can be computed for any body position. The joint moments calculated with the model compare well with experimentally measured isometric joint moments. A graphical interface to the model has also been developed. It allows the user to visualize the musculoskeletal geometry and to manipulate the model parameters to study the biomechanical consequences of orthopaedic surgical procedures. For example, tendon transfer and lengthening procedures can be simulated by adjusting the model parameters according to various surgical techniques. Results of the simulated surgeries can be analyzed quickly in terms of postsurgery muscle forces and other biomechanical variables.},

Using a geometrical model of planar arm movements with three degrees of freedom, we present, in an analytical form, the available information on the relationship between MAs and MLs and joint angles for thirteen human upper limb muscles. The degrees of freedom included are shoulder flexion/extension, elbow flexion/extension, and either wrist flexion/extension (the forearm in supination) or radial/ulnar deviation (the forearm in mid-pronation). Previously published MA/angle curves were approximated by polynomials. ML/angle curves were obtained by combining the constant values of MLs (defined by the distance between the origin and insertion points for a specific upper limb position) with a variable part obtained by multiplying the MA (joint radius) and the joint angle. The MAs of the prime wrist movers in radial/ulnar deviation were linear functions of the joint angle (R2 ≥ 0.9904), while quadratic polynomials accurately described their MAs during wrist flexion/extensions. The relationship between MAs and the elbow angle was described by 2nd, 3rd or 5th-order polynomials (R2 ≥ 0.9904), with a lesser quality of fit for the anconeus (R2 = 0.9349). In the full range of angular displacements, the length of wrist, elbow and shoulder muscles can change by 8.5, 55 and 200\%, respectively.},

Examination of the mean fibre type proportions of each muscle revealed that predominantly tonic muscles had a high percentage of Type I fibres and predominantly phasic muscles had a high percentage of Type II fibres. Most of the muscles studied were known to fulfil both tonic and phasic functions, however, and showed no striking preponderance of either fibre type. The spatial distribution of the fibre types was examined in order to determine whether this was random or not. The number of “enclosed” fibres observed in the actual samples was compared statistically with the number expected to occur in a hexagonal lattice model, assuming a random distribution. In the great majority of muscles, the distribution of the fibre types was in fact random, though isolated instances of grouping of fibres of uniform type were noted in some distal muscles and more regularly in extensor digitorum brevis. The methods used in the quantitative assessment of the proportions and spatial distribution of the respective fibre types in normal muscle have obvious applications in the study of neuromuscular disease.},

Electrical stimulation was used to activate an individual muscle selectively at various contraction levels, and the relationship between the peak M-wave amplitude and peak elbow extension moment was established across various contraction levels for each muscle. The relationship was then used to calibrate the corresponding EMG signal and determine moment distribution among the muscles during voluntary isometric elbow extension. Results showed that moment distribution among muscles was not proportional to the muscles’ physiological cross-sectional areas (PCSA) and the CNS favored uniarticular muscles for the isometric task performed: the uniarticular lateral and medial heads of the triceps were dominant (contributing ∼70–90\% of the total elbow extension moment) and the anconeus contributed significantly, especially at the lower levels of elbow extension moment (up to ∼15\% of the extension moment). In contrast, the two-joint long head of the triceps contributed significantly less than the uniarticular heads of the triceps. While the absolute contributions of all the muscles increased with the total elbow extension moment, the relative contributions of the muscles may increase or decrease with the elbow extension moment. Cross-validation using fresh data (not used in determining the moment distribution) showed close match between the measured and predicted elbow extension moment except for trials in which fatigue became significant.},

The distribution of different fiber types varied within the muscles, as a function of depth, with a predominance of type 2b fibers at the surface and type 1 fibers in deeper regions of the muscle. For all the analyzed muscles the contraction times measured at stimulus intensity 10\% of supramaximal stimulus (10\% MS) were significantly (p{\textbackslash}textless0.05) shorter than the contraction times measured at 50\% of supramaximal stimulus intensity (50\% MS). The Pearson's correlation coefficient between percentage of type 1 muscle fibers measured at the surface of the muscle and contraction time at 10\% MS, obtained by TMG was statistically significant (r=0.76,P{\textbackslash}textless0.01). Also the Pearson's correlation coefficient between percentage of type 1 muscle fibers measured in the deep region of the muscle and contraction time at 50\% MS obtained by TMG was also statistically significant (r=0.90,P{\textbackslash}textless0.001). These findings suggest that the contraction time obtained by TMG may be useful for non-invasive examining of muscle fiber types spatial distribution in humans.},

Moment arm values were derived from a plot of tendon excursion versus glenohumeral joint rotation angle during horizontal flexion along the 90° elevation plane and elevation in the sagittal, scapular, and coronal planes. The deltoid had the largest moment arm in elevation. The anterior deltoid has a larger moment arm in the anterior planes, whereas the midportion is greater in the scapular and coronal planes. The muscles with the largest depressor (adductor) moment arms are the pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi, and teres major. Contrary to the findings of other investigators, the supraspinatus and infraspinatus have a smaller potential elevation torque in the scapular plane than has been previously reported. Furthermore the subscapularis may potentially be a more important elevator in the scapular plane than either the supraspinatus or infraspinatus, especially in the latter phases of motion. The pectoralis major has the largest horizontal flexion moment arm with the humerus elevated 90°, whereas the posterior deltoid and infraspinatus have the largest horizontal extension moment arms in this plane.

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to validate the mathematical predictions of individual muscle forces obtained using optimization models. Mathematical muscle force predictions were made using linear and nonlinear optimization models proposed in the literature. Actual muscle forces were measured experimentally from soleus, gastrocnemius and plantaris muscles of an adult male cat during a variety of locomotor tasks. Mathematically predicted muscle forces did not agree well with the experimentally determined muscle forces, because changes in force sharing during given step cycles and for different locomotor speeds were largely ignored in the theoretical models tested. It is suggested that changes in force sharing during given step cycles may be caused by differences in force-velocity characteristics or small time delays of onset of activation between muscles; whereas changes in force sharing associated with different speeds of locomotion may be caused by corresponding changes in the magnitude of centrally controlled activation. Theoretical simulations testing the feasibility of these suggestions were encouraging. In view of the findings of this study, it is suggested that future models should be developed and validated based on experimental findings.},

Muscle moment-arm data for sub-regions of the shoulder musculature during humeral elevation are currently not available. The tendon-excursion method was used to measure instantaneous muscle moment arms in eight entire upper-extremity cadaver specimens. Significant differences in moment arms were reported across sub-regions of the deltoid, pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi, subscapularis, infraspinatus and supraspinatus (P {\textbackslash}textless 0.01). The most effective abductors were the middle and anterior deltoid, whereas the most effective adductors were the teres major, middle and inferior latissimus dorsi (lumbar vertebrae and iliac crest fibers, respectively), and middle and inferior pectoralis major (sternal and lower-costal fibers, respectively). In flexion, the superior pectoralis major (clavicular fibers), anterior and posterior supraspinatus, and anterior deltoid were the most effective flexors, whereas the teres major and posterior deltoid had the largest extensor moment arms. Division of multi-pennate shoulder muscles of broad origins into sub-regions highlighted distinct functional differences across those sub-regions. Most significantly, we found that the superior sub-region of the pectoralis major had the capacity to exert substantial torque in flexion, whereas the middle and inferior sub-regions tended to behave as a stabilizer and extensor, respectively. Knowledge of moment arm differences between muscle sub-regions may assist in identifying the functional effects of muscle sub-region tears, assist surgeons in planning tendon reconstructive surgery, and aid in the development and validation of biomechanical computer models used in implant design.},

After a survey on IMU-based human tracking, five techniques for motion reconstruction were selected and compared to reconstruct a human arm motion. IMU based estimation was matched against motion tracking based on the Vicon marker-based motion tracking system considered as ground truth. Results show that all but one of the selected models perform similarly (about 35 mm average position estimation error).},

For that reason, a different compensation method and thus calibration process has to be developed.

	abstract = {Wearable robotic devices can restore and enhance mobility. There is growing interest in designing devices that reduce the metabolic cost of walking; however, designers lack guidelines for which joints to assist and when to provide the assistance. To help address this problem, we used musculoskeletal simulation to predict how hypothetical devices affect muscle activity and metabolic cost when walking with heavy loads. We explored 7 massless devices, each providing unrestricted torque at one degree of freedom in one direction (hip abduction, hip flexion, hip extension, knee flexion, knee extension, ankle plantarflexion, or ankle dorsiflexion). We used the Computed Muscle Control algorithm in OpenSim to find device torque profiles that minimized the sum of squared muscle activations while tracking measured kinematics of loaded walking without assistance. We then examined the metabolic savings provided by each device, the corresponding device torque profiles, and the resulting changes in muscle activity. We found that the hip flexion, knee flexion, and hip abduction devices provided greater metabolic savings than the ankle plantarflexion device. The hip abduction device had the greatest ratio of metabolic savings to peak instantaneous positive device power, suggesting that frontal-plane hip assistance may be an efficient way to reduce metabolic cost. Overall, the device torque profiles generally differed from the corresponding net joint moment generated by muscles without assistance, and occasionally exceeded the net joint moment to reduce muscle activity at other degrees of freedom. Many devices affected the activity of muscles elsewhere in the limb; for example, the hip flexion device affected muscles that span the ankle joint. Our results may help experimentalists decide which joint motions to target when building devices and can provide intuition for how devices may interact with the musculoskeletal system. The simulations are freely available online, allowing others to reproduce and extend our work.},

	abstract = {Author Summary When performing reaching and grasping movements, the brain has to choose one trajectory among an infinite set of possibilities. Nevertheless, because human and animal movements provide highly stereotyped features, motor strategies used by the brain were assumed to be optimal according to certain optimality criteria. In this study, we propose a theoretical model for motor planning of arm movements that minimizes a compromise between the absolute work exerted by the muscles and the integral of the squared acceleration. We demonstrate that under these assumptions agonistic and antagonistic muscles are inactivated during overlapping periods of time for quick enough movements. Moreover, it is shown that only this type of criterion can predict these inactivation periods. Finally, experimental evidence is in agreement with the predictions of the model. Indeed, we report the existence of simultaneous inactivation of opposing muscles during fast vertical arm movements. Therefore, this study suggests that biological movements partly optimize the energy expenditure, integrating both inertial and gravitational forces during the motor planning process.},

	abstract = {A three-dimensional, neuromusculoskeletal model of the body was combined with dynamic optimization theory to simulate normal walking on level ground. The body was modeled as a 23 degree-of-freedom mechanical linkage, actuated by 54 muscles. The dynamic optimization problem was to calculate the muscle excitation histories, muscle forces, and limb motions subject to minimum metabolic energy expenditure per unit distance traveled. Muscle metabolic energy was calculated by summing five terms: the basal or resting heat, activation heat, maintenance heat, shortening heat, and the mechanical work done by all the muscles in the model. The gait cycle was assumed to be symmetric; that is, the muscle excitations for the right and left legs and the initial and terminal states in the model were assumed to be equal. Importantly, a tracking problem was not solved. Rather, only a set of terminal constraints was placed on the states of the model to enforce repeatability of the gait cycle. Quantitative comparisons of the model predictions with patterns of body-segmental displacements, ground-reaction forces, and muscle activations obtained from experiment show that the simulation reproduces the salient features of normal gait. The simulation results suggest that minimum metabolic energy per unit distance traveled is a valid measure of walking performance.},

Humans running at any particular speed appear to naturally select a stride length that maintains a low CoT when compared with other possible stride lengths. However, it is unknown if the nervous system prioritizes the CoT itself for minimization, or if some other quantity is minimized and a low CoT is a consequential effect. To address this question, we generated predictive computer simulations of running using an anatomically inspired musculoskeletal model and compared the results with data collected from human runners. Three simulations were generated by minimizing the CoT, the total muscle activation or the total muscle stress, respectively. While all the simulations qualitatively resembled real human running, minimizing activation predicted the most realistic joint angles and timing of muscular activity. While minimizing the CoT naturally predicted the lowest CoT, minimizing activation predicted a more realistic CoT in comparison with the experimental mean. The results suggest a potential control strategy centred on muscle activation for economical running.},

Costs are calculated for the range of possible trajectories, for movements between the end points used in previously published experiments. Calculated energy minimizing trajectories for a model with biarticular elbow muscles agree well with observed trajectories for fast movements. Good agreement is also obtained for slow movements if they are assumed to be performed by slower muscles. A model in which all muscles are uniarticular is less successful in predicting observed trajectories. The effects of loads and of reversing the direction of movement are investigated.},

Recent estimates of leg swing costs are equivocal, covering a range from 10 to 33 per cent of the net cost of walking. There has also been a debate as to whether the periods of double-limb support during the stance phase dominate the cost of walking. Part of this uncertainty is because of our inability to measure metabolic energy consumption in individual muscles during locomotion. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the metabolic cost of walking using a modelling approach that allowed instantaneous energy consumption rates in individual muscles to be estimated over the full gait cycle. At a typical walking speed and stride rate, leg swing represented 29 per cent of the total muscular cost. During the stance phase, the double-limb and single-limb support periods accounted for 27 and 44 per cent of the total cost, respectively. Performing step-to-step transitions, which encompasses more than just the double-support periods, represented 37 per cent of the total cost of walking. Increasing stride rate at a constant speed led to greater double-limb support costs, lower swing phase costs and no change in single-limb support costs. Together, these results provide unique insight as to how metabolic energy is expended over the human gait cycle.},

	abstract = {It is often assumed that the CNS controls movements in a manner that minimizes energetic cost. While empirical evidence for actual metabolic minimization exists in locomotion, actual metabolic cost has yet to be measured during motor learning and/or arm reaching. Here, we measured metabolic power consumption using expired gas analysis, as humans learned novel arm reaching dynamics. We hypothesized that (1) metabolic power would decrease with motor learning and (2) muscle activity and coactivation would parallel changes in metabolic power. Seated subjects made horizontal planar reaching movements toward a target using a robotic arm. The novel dynamics involved compensating for a viscous curl force field that perturbed reaching movements. Metabolic power was measured continuously throughout the protocol. Subjects decreased movement error and learned the novel dynamics. By the end of learning, net metabolic power decreased by ∼20\% (∼0.1 W/kg) from initial learning. Muscle activity and coactivation also decreased with motor learning. Interestingly, distinct and significant reductions in metabolic power occurred even after muscle activity and coactivation had stabilized and movement changes were small. These results provide the first evidence of actual metabolic reduction during motor learning and for a reaching task. Further, they suggest that muscle activity may not explain changes in metabolic cost as completely as previously thought. Additional mechanisms such as more subtle features of arm muscle activity, changes in activity of other muscles, and/or more efficient neural processes may also underlie the reduction in metabolic cost during motor learning.},

This problem is particularly difficult because a variety of muscle subsets can usually be used to produce the same joint motion. The motor system is therefore faced with a motor redundancy problem that must be resolved to produce the movement. In this paper, we present a model of muscle recruitment in the wrist step-tracking task. Muscle activation levels for five muscles are selected so as to satisfy task constraints (moving to the designated target) while also minimizing a measure of the total effort in producing the movement. Imposing these constraints yields muscle activation patterns qualitatively similar to those observed experimentally. In particular, the model reproduces the observed cosine-like recruitment of muscles as a function of movement direction and also appropriately predicts that certain muscles will be recruited most strongly in movement directions that differ significantly from their direction of action. These results suggest that the observed recruitment behavior may not be an explicit strategy employed by the nervous system, but instead may result from a process of movement optimization.},

It is commonly suggested that the brain addresses these by first constructing representations of the world on which to build knowledge and make a decision, and then by computing and executing an action plan. However, neurophysiological data argue against this serial viewpoint. In contrast, it is proposed here that the brain processes sensory information to specify, in parallel, several potential actions that are currently available. These potential actions compete against each other for further processing, while information is collected to bias this competition until a single response is selected. The hypothesis suggests that the dorsal visual system specifies actions which compete against each other within the fronto-parietal cortex, while a variety of biasing influences are provided by prefrontal regions and the basal ganglia. A computational model is described, which illustrates how this competition may take place in the cerebral cortex. Simulations of the model capture qualitative features of neurophysiological data and reproduce various behavioural phenomena.},

Accordingly, several studies have shown that the value-functions of rewards decrease proportionally to the effort required to secure them (effort-discounting). Nevertheless, it is unclear whether and how the momentary physiological condition of the body (e.g., fatigue) influences cost-benefit computations and the evaluation of future prospects. Design Participants were asked to make a series of effort-based choices between two different effort-demanding monetary outcomes, which varied both in reward magnitudes (money) and effort (time to be spent cycling on a bicycle ergometer at submaximal performance of ∼70\% of Vo2max after the experimental session). The tests were performed in two conditions: when participants were fatigued versus not fatigued. Methods Visual presentation of the choice alternatives and recordings of the subjects’ responses were performed using the Mouse Tracker software, which allowed the recording of the kinematics of the mouse movements associated with the choice of 20 human subjects. Results Our findings show that fatigued participants increased their preference for less-costly offers, which indicates effort-discount (i.e., decrease of participants' value functions). Kinematic analysis of participants' choices revealed the dynamical signature of this preference shift: while non-fatigued participants had a strong initial bias for the higher-value, higher-effort choice offer, this bias lacked in fatigued participants. Conclusions Our results suggest that increased fatigue levels may “scale up” effort-costs, counteracting the (otherwise default) choice of higher-valued offers. These results are relevant for the ongoing debate on whether and why fatigue impairs athletes’ ability to select actions optimally.},

	abstract = {Physical interaction with tools is ubiquitous in functional activities of daily living. While tool use is considered a hallmark of human behavior, how humans control such physical interactions is still poorly understood. When humans perform a motor task, it is commonly suggested that the central nervous system coordinates the musculo-skeletal system to minimize muscle effort. In this paper, we tested if this notion holds true for motor tasks that involve physical interaction. Specifically, we investigated whether humans minimize muscle forces to control physical interaction with a circular kinematic constraint.Using a simplified arm model, we derived three predictions for how humans should behave if they were minimizing muscular effort to perform the task. First, we predicted that subjects would exert workless, radial forces on the constraint. Second, we predicted that the muscles would be deactivated when they could not contribute to work. Third, we predicted that when moving very slowly along the constraint, the pattern of muscle activity would not differ between clockwise (CW) and counterclockwise (CCW) motions.To test these predictions, we instructed human subjects to move a robot handle around a virtual, circular constraint at a constant tangential velocity. To reduce the effect of forces that might arise from incomplete compensation of neuro-musculo-skeletal dynamics, the target tangential speed was set to an extremely slow pace (∼1 revolution every 13.3 seconds). Ultimately, the results of human experiment did not support the predictions derived from our model of minimizing muscular effort. While subjects did exert workless forces, they did not deactivate muscles as predicted. Furthermore, muscle activation patterns differed between CW and CCW motions about the constraint. These findings demonstrate that minimizing muscle effort is not a significant factor in human performance of this constrained-motion task. Instead, the central nervous system likely prioritizes reducing other costs, such as computational effort, over muscle effort to control physical interactions.},

In ecology and economics, they are combined to form a utility function which is maximized to guide choices. This principle is widely used in neuroscience as a normative model of decision and action, but current versions of this model fail to consider how decisions are actually converted into actions (i.e. the formation of trajectories). Here, we describe an approach where decision making and motor control are optimal, iterative processes derived from the maximization of the discounted, weighted difference between expected rewards and foreseeable motor efforts. The model accounts for decision making in cost/benefit situations, and detailed characteristics of control and goal tracking in realistic motor tasks. As a normative construction, the model is relevant to address the neural bases and pathological aspects of decision making and motor control.},

	abstract = {The public pays large sums of money to watch skilled motor performance. Notably, however, in recent decades motor skill learning (performance improvement beyond baseline levels) has received less experimental attention than motor adaptation (return to baseline performance in the setting of an external perturbation). Motor skill can be assessed at the levels of task success and movement quality, but the link between these levels remains poorly understood. We devised a motor skill task that required visually guided curved movements of the wrist without a perturbation, and we defined skill learning at the task level as a change in the speed–accuracy trade-off function (SAF). Practice in restricted speed ranges led to a global shift of the SAF. We asked how the SAF shift maps onto changes in trajectory kinematics, to establish a link between task-level performance and fine motor control. Although there were small changes in mean trajectory, improved performance largely consisted of reduction in trial-to-trial variability and increase in movement smoothness. We found evidence for improved feedback control, which could explain the reduction in variability but does not preclude other explanations such as an increased signal-to-noise ratio in cortical representations. Interestingly, submovement structure remained learning invariant. The global generalization of the SAF across a wide range of difficulty suggests that skill for this task is represented in a temporally scalable network. We propose that motor skill acquisition can be characterized as a slow reduction in movement variability, which is distinct from faster model-based learning that reduces systematic error in adaptation paradigms.},

	abstract = {Making a movement may be thought of as an economic decision in which one spends effort to acquire reward. Time discounts reward, which predicts that the magnitude of reward should affect movement vigor: we should move faster, spending greater effort, when there is greater reward at stake. Indeed, saccade peak velocities are greater and reaction-times shorter when a target is paired with reward. In this study, we focused on human reaching and asked whether movement kinematics were affected by expectation of reward. Participants made out-and-back reaching movements to one of four quadrants of a 14-cm circle. During various periods of the experiment only one of the four quadrants was paired with reward, and the transition from reward to nonreward status of a quadrant occurred randomly. Our experiment design minimized dependence of reward on accuracy, granting the subjects wide latitude in self-selecting their movement speed, amplitude, and variability. When a quadrant was paired with reward, reaching movements had a shorter reaction time, higher peak velocity, and greater amplitude. Despite this greater vigor, movements toward the rewarded quadrant suffered from less variability: both reaction times and reach kinematics were less variable when there was expectation of reward. Importantly, the effect of reward on vigor was specific to the movement component that preceded the time of reward (outward reach), not the movement component that followed it (return reach). Our results suggest that expectation of reward not only increases vigor of human reaching but also decreases its variability.NEW \& NOTEWORTHY Movements may be thought of as an economic transaction where the vigor of the movement represents the effort that the brain is willing to expend to acquire a rewarding state. We show that in reaching, reward discounts the cost of effort, producing movements with shorter reaction time, higher velocity, greater amplitude, and reduced reaction-time variability. These results complement earlier observations in saccades, suggesting a common principle of economics across modalities of motor control.},

	abstract = {When deciding between alternative options, a rational agent chooses on the basis of the desirability of each outcome, including associated costs. As different options typically result in different actions, the effort associated with each action is an essential cost parameter. How do humans discount physical effort when deciding between movements? We used an action-selection task to characterize how subjective effort depends on the parameters of arm transport movements and controlled for potential confounding factors such as delay discounting and performance. First, by repeatedly asking subjects to choose between 2 arm movements of different amplitudes or durations, performed against different levels of force, we identified parameter combinations that subjects experienced as identical in effort (isoeffort curves). Movements with a long duration were judged more effortful than short-duration movements against the same force, while movement amplitudes did not influence effort. Biomechanics of the movements also affected effort, as movements towards the body midline were preferred to movements away from it. Second, by introducing movement repetitions, we further determined that the cost function for choosing between effortful movements had a quadratic relationship with force, while choices were made on the basis of the logarithm of these costs. Our results show that effort-based action selection during reaching cannot easily be explained by metabolic costs. Instead, force-loaded reaches, a widely occurring natural behavior, imposed an effort cost for decision making similar to cost functions in motor control. Our results thereby support the idea that motor control and economic choice are governed by partly overlapping optimization principles.},

Yet, the principles underlying the formation of human movement vigour remain unclear, particularly in view of intriguing inter-individual variability. It has been hypothesized that how the brain values time may be the cornerstone of such differences, beyond biomechanics. Here, we focused on the vigour of self-paced reaching movement and assessed the stability of vigour via repeated measurements within participants. We used an optimal control methodology to identify a cost of time (CoT) function underlying each participant’s vigour, considering a model of the biomechanical cost of movement. We then tested the extent to which anthropometric or psychological traits, namely boredom proneness and impulsivity, could account for a significant part of inter-individual variance in vigour and CoT parameters. Our findings show that the vigour of reaching is largely idiosyncratic and tend to corroborate a relation between the relative steepness of the identified CoT and boredom proneness, a psychological trait relevant to one’s relationship with time in decision-making.},

	abstract = {During foraging, animals decide how long to stay at a patch and harvest reward, and then, they move with certain vigor to another location. How does the brain decide when to leave, and how does it determine the speed of the ensuing movement? Here, we considered the possibility that both the decision-making and the motor control problems aimed to maximize a single normative utility: the sum of all rewards acquired minus all efforts expended divided by total time. This optimization could be achieved if the brain compared a local measure of utility with its history. To test the theory, we examined behavior of people as they gazed at images: they chose how long to look at the image (harvesting information) and then moved their eyes to another image, controlling saccade speed. We varied reward via image content and effort via image eccentricity, and then, we measured how these changes affected decision making (gaze duration) and motor control (saccade speed). After a history of low rewards, people increased gaze duration and decreased saccade speed. In anticipation of future effort, they lowered saccade speed and increased gaze duration. After a history of high effort, they elevated their saccade speed and increased gaze duration. Therefore, the theory presented a principled way with which the brain may control two aspects of behavior: movement speed and harvest duration. Our experiments confirmed many (but not all) of the predictions, suggesting that harvest duration and movement speed, fundamental aspects of behavior during foraging, may be governed by a shared principle of control.},

	abstract = {A common aspect of individuality is our subjective preferences in evaluation of reward and effort. The neural circuits that evaluate these commodities influence circuits that control our movements, raising the possibility that vigor differences between individuals may also be a trait of individuality, reflecting a willingness to expend effort. In contrast, classic theories in motor control suggest that vigor differences reflect a speed-accuracy trade-off, predicting that those who move fast are sacrificing accuracy for speed. Here we tested these contrasting hypotheses. We measured motion of the eyes, head, and arm in healthy humans during various elementary movements (saccades, head-free gaze shifts, and reaching). For each person we characterized their vigor, i.e., the speed with which they moved a body part (peak velocity) with respect to the population mean. Some moved with low vigor, while others moved with high vigor. Those with high vigor tended to react sooner to a visual stimulus, moving both their eyes and arm with a shorter reaction time. Arm and head vigor were tightly linked: individuals who moved their head with high vigor also moved their arm with high vigor. However, eye vigor did not correspond strongly with arm or head vigor. In all modalities, vigor had no impact on end-point accuracy, demonstrating that differences in vigor were not due to a speed-accuracy trade-off. Our results suggest that movement vigor may be a trait of individuality, not reflecting a willingness to accept inaccuracy but demonstrating a propensity to expend effort. NEW \& NOTEWORTHY A common aspect of individuality is how we evaluate economic variables like reward and effort. This valuation affects not only decision making but also motor control, raising the possibility that vigor may be distinct between individuals but conserved across movements within an individual. Here we report conservation of vigor across elementary skeletal movements, but not eye movements, raising the possibility that the individuality of our movements may be driven by a common neural mechanism of effort evaluation across modalities of skeletal motor control.},

We quantified oxygen uptake, metabolic rate, and cost of transport in 10 average and 10 sub-elite runners. We increased treadmill speed by 0.45 m · s −1 from 1.78 m · s −1 (day 1) and 2.01 m · s −1 (day 2) during each subsequent 4-min stage until reaching a speed that elicited a rating of perceived exertion of 15. Average runners’ oxygen uptake and metabolic rate vs. speed relationships were best described by linear fits. In contrast, the sub-elite runners’ relationships were best described by increasing curvilinear fits. For the sub-elites, oxygen cost of transport and energy cost of transport increased by 12.8\% and 9.6\%, respectively, from 3.58 to 5.14 m · s −1 . Our results indicate that it is not possible to accurately predict metabolic rates at race pace for sub-elite competitive runners from data collected at moderate submaximal running speeds (2.68–3.58 m · s −1 ). To do so, metabolic rate should be measured at speeds that approach competitive race pace and curvilinear fits should be used for extrapolation to race pace.},

Our results show that the optimal trajectory that minimizes the expected value of energy cost under the effect of signal-dependent noise on motor commands expresses not only the characteristics of reaching movements of typical speed but also those of slower movements.

	abstract = {Adaptation is sometimes viewed as a process where the nervous system learns to predict and cancel effects of a novel environment, returning movements to near baseline (unperturbed) conditions. An alternate view is that cancellation is not the goal of adaptation. Rather, the goal is to maximize performance in that environment. If performance criteria are well defined, theory allows one to predict the re-optimized trajectory. For example, if velocity dependent forces perturb the hand perpendicular to the direction of a reaching movement, the best reach plan is not a straight line but a curved path that appears to over-compensate for the forces. If this environment is stochastic (changing from trial to trial), the re-optimized plan should take into account this uncertainty, removing the over-compensation. If the stochastic environment is zero-mean, peak velocities should increase to allow for more time to approach the target. Finally, if one is reaching through a via-point, the optimum plan in a zero-mean deterministic environment is a smooth movement, but in a zero-mean stochastic environment is a segmented movement. We observed all of these tendencies in how people adapt to novel environments. Therefore, motor control in a novel environment is not a process of perturbation cancellation. Rather, the process resembles re-optimization: through practice in the novel environment, we learn internal models that predict sensory consequences of motor commands. Through reward based optimization, we use the internal model to search for a better movement plan to minimize implicit motor costs and maximize rewards.},

To learn and understand more about the control of human motion, we use rigid multibody systems to represent bones and joints and formulate an optimal control problem (OCP) with the goal to minimise a physiologically motivated cost function, while the equations of motion and further nonlinear constraints have to be fulfilled. The investigated biomechanical movements are induced either via joint torques or via Hill-type muscle forces. We compare several cost functions known from literature to another one concerning the impact on the joints by involving the constraint forces. A direct transcription method called DMOCC (discrete mechanics and optimal control for constraint systems) is used to solve the OCP, whereby we benefit from its structure preserving formulation, as the resulting optimal discrete trajectories are symplectic-momentum preserving.},

	abstract = {This is a report of experiments on ankle extensor muscles of human subjects and a parallel series on the medial gastrocnemius of the anaesthetised cat, investigating the origin of the rise in passive tension after a period of eccentric exercise. Subjects exercised their triceps surae of one leg eccentrically by walking backwards on an inclined, forward-moving treadmill. Concentric exercise required walking forwards on a backwards-moving treadmill. For all subjects the other leg acted as a control. Immediately after both eccentric and concentric exercise there was a significant drop in peak active torque, but only after eccentric exercise was this accompanied by a shift in optimum angle for torque generation and a rise in passive torque. In the eccentrically exercised group some swelling and soreness developed but not until 24 h post-exercise. In the animal experiments the contracting muscle was stretched by 6 mm at 50 mm s−1 over a length range symmetrical about the optimum length for tension generation. Measurements of passive tension were made before and after the eccentric contractions, using small stretches to a range of muscle lengths, or with large stretches covering the full physiological range. After 150 eccentric contractions, passive tension was significantly elevated over most of the range of lengths. Measurements of work absorption during stretch-release cycles showed significant increases after the contractions. It is suggested that the rise in passive tension in both human and animal muscles after eccentric contractions is the result of development of injury contractures in damaged muscle fibres.},

	abstract = {Reaching movements are comprised of the coordinated action across multiple joints. The human skeleton is redundant for this task because different joint configurations can lead to the same endpoint in space. How do people learn to use combinations of joints that maximize success in goal-directed motor tasks? To answer this question, we used a 3-degree-of-freedom manipulandum to measure shoulder, elbow and wrist joint movements during reaching in a plane. We tested whether a shift in the relative contribution of the wrist and elbow joints to a reaching movement could be learned by an implicit reinforcement regime. Unknown to the participants, we decreased the task success for certain joint configurations (wrist flexion or extension, respectively) by adding random variability to the endpoint feedback. In return, the opposite wrist postures were rewarded in the two experimental groups (flexion and extension group). We found that the joint configuration slowly shifted towards movements that provided more control over the endpoint and hence higher task success. While the overall learning was significant, only the group that was guided to extend the wrist joint more during the movement showed substantial learning. Importantly, all changes in movement pattern occurred independent of conscious awareness of the experimental manipulation. These findings suggest that the motor system is generally sensitive to its output variability and can optimize joint-space solutions that minimize task-relevant output variability. We discuss biomechanical biases (e.g. joint’s range of movement) that could impose hurdles to the learning process.},

	abstract = {Each of our movements is selected from any number of alternative movements. Some studies have shown evidence that the central nervous system (CNS) chooses to make the specific movements that are least affected by motor noise. Previous results showing that the CNS has a natural tendency to minimize the effects of noise make the direct prediction that if the relationship between movements and noise were to change, the specific movements people learn to make would also change in a predictable manner. Indeed, this has been shown for well-practiced movements such as reaching. Here, we artificially manipulated the relationship between movements and visuomotor noise by adding noise to a motor task in a novel redundant geometry such that there arose a single control policy that minimized the noise. This allowed us to see whether, for a novel motor task, people could learn the specific control policy that minimized noise or would need to employ other compensation strategies to overcome the added noise. As predicted, subjects were able to learn movements that were biased toward the specific ones that minimized the noise, suggesting not only that the CNS can learn to minimize the effects of noise in a novel motor task but also that artificial visuomotor noise can be a useful tool for teaching people to make specific movements. Using noise as a teaching signal promises to be useful for rehabilitative therapies and movement training with human-machine interfaces. NEW \& NOTEWORTHY Many theories argue that we choose to make the specific movements that minimize motor noise. Here, by changing the relationship between movements and noise, we show that people actively learn to make movements that minimize noise. This not only provides direct evidence for the theories of noise minimization but presents a way to use noise to teach specific movements to improve rehabilitative therapies and human-machine interface control.},

	abstract = {Author Summary To reach an object, the brain has to select among a set of possible arm trajectories that displace the hand from an initial to a final desired position. Because of the intrinsic redundancy characterizing the human arm, the number of admissible joint trajectories toward the goal is generally infinite. However, many studies have demonstrated that the range of actual trajectories can be limited to those that result from the fulfillment of some optimal rules. Various cost functions were shown to be relevant in the literature. A peculiar aspect of most of these costs is that each one of them aims at optimizing one specific feature of the movement. The necessary motor flexibility of everyday life, however, might rely on the combination of such cost functions rather than on a single one. Testing this cost combination hypothesis has never been attempted. To this aim we propose a reaching task involving target redundancy to facilitate the comparisons of different candidate costs and to identify the best-fitting one (possibly composite). Using a numerical inverse optimal control method, we show that most participants produced movements corresponding to a strict combination of two subjective costs linked to the mechanical energy consumption and the joint-level smoothness.},

	abstract = {Humans seem to adjust their walking and running gaits to minimise the metabolic energy cost of locomotion. The walking speed that we tend to prefer is the one that minimises energy cost per unit distance, though faster speeds might seem preferable when time is valuable. At speeds up to 2 m/s, walking requires less energy than running, and we walk. At higher speeds, running is more economical, and we run. At each speed we use the stride length that minimises energy costs. A computer model that predicts metabolic rates for all conceivable gaits of a simple biped helps to understand these and other features of human gait. The energy cost of walking is increased on uphill slopes and also on soft ground. Consequently, zigzag paths should be preferred to straight ones, up hills of more than a critical gradient. Also, it may be more economical to divert a path around a hill than to travel along a straight line. Simple theories of optimum diversions are presented, both for hilly ground and for ground interrupted by marshy patches, on which costs of walking are increased. Energy costs are also increased by heavy loads, though it seems possible in some circumstances to carry moderate loads without measurable extra cost. Am. J. Hum.

	abstract = {1. Isometric muscle force and the surface electromyogram (EMG) were simulated from a model that predicted recruitment and firing times in a pool of 120 motor units under different levels of excitatory drive. The EMG-force relationships that emerged from simulations using various schedules of recruitment and rate coding were compared with those observed experimentally to determine which of the modeled schemes were plausible representations of the actual organization in motor-unit pools. 2. The model was comprised of three elements: a motoneuron model, a motor-unit force model, and a model of the surface EMG. Input to the neuron model was an excitatory drive function representing the net synaptic input to motoneurons during voluntary muscle contractions. Recruitment thresholds were assigned such that many motoneurons had low thresholds and relatively few neurons had high thresholds. Motoneuron firing rate increased as a linear function of excitatory drive between recruitment threshold and peak firing rate levels. The sequence of discharge times for each motoneuron was simulated as a random renewal process. 3. Motor-unit twitch force was estimated as an impulse response of a critically damped, second-order system. Twitch amplitudes were assigned according to rank in the recruitment order, and twitch contraction times were inversely related to twitch amplitude. Nonlinear force-firing rate behavior was simulated by varying motor-unit force gain as a function of the instantaneous firing rate and the contraction time of the unit. The total force exerted by the muscle was computed as the sum of the motor-unit forces. 4. Motor-unit action potentials were simulated on the basis of estimates of the number and location of motor-unit muscle fibers and the propagation velocity of the fiber action potentials. The number of fibers innervated by each unit was assumed to be directly proportional to the twitch force. The area of muscle encompassing unit fibers was proportional to the number of fibers innervated, and the location of motor-unit territories were randomly assigned within the muscle cross section. Action-potential propagation velocities were estimated from an inverse function of contraction time. The train of discharge times predicted from the motoneuron model determined the occurrence of each motor-unit action potential. The surface EMG was synthesized as the sum of all motor-unit action-potential trains. 5. Two recruitment conditions were tested: narrow (limit of recruitment {\textbackslash}textless 50\% maximum excitation) and broad recruitment range conditions (limit of recruitment {\textbackslash}textgreater 70\% maximum excitation).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

An especially puzzling aspect of coordination is that behavioral goals are achieved reliably and repeatedly with movements rarely reproducible in their detail. Existing theoretical frameworks emphasize either goal achievement or the richness of motor variability, but fail to reconcile the two. Here we propose an alternative theory based on stochastic optimal feedback control. We show that the optimal strategy in the face of uncertainty is to allow variability in redundant (task-irrelevant) dimensions. This strategy does not enforce a desired trajectory, but uses feedback more intelligently, correcting only those deviations that interfere with task goals. From this framework, task-constrained variability, goal-directed corrections, motor synergies, controlled parameters, simplifying rules and discrete coordination modes emerge naturally. We present experimental results from a range of motor tasks to support this theory.},

The software employs graphic user interfaces (GUI) and dynamic data exchange (DDE) to facilitate building custom muscle model blocks and linking them to kinetic analyses of complete musculoskeletal systems. It is scalable in complexity and accuracy. The model is based on recently published data on muscle and tendon properties measured in feline slow- and fast-twitch muscle, and incorporates a novel approach to simulating recruitment and frequency modulation of different fiber-types in mixed muscles.

	abstract = {Human motor control is highly efficient in generating accurate and appropriate motor behavior for a multitude of tasks. This paper examines how kinematic and dynamic properties of the musculoskeletal system are controlled to achieve such efficiency. Even though recent studies have shown that the human motor control relies on multiple models, how the central nervous system (CNS) controls this combination is not fully addressed. In this study, we utilize an Inverse Optimal Control (IOC) framework in order to find the combination of those internal models and how this combination changes for different reaching tasks. We conducted an experiment where participants executed a comprehensive set of free-space reaching motions. The results show that there is a trade-off between kinematics and dynamics based controllers depending on the reaching task. In addition, this trade-off depends on the initial and final arm configurations, which in turn affect the musculoskeletal load to be controlled. Given this insight, we further provide a discomfort metric to demonstrate its influence on the contribution of different inverse internal models. This formulation together with our analysis not only support the multiple internal models (MIMs) hypothesis but also suggest a hierarchical framework for the control of human reaching motions by the CNS.},

	abstract = {Dopamine has been suggested to be crucially involved in effort-related choices. Key findings are that dopamine depletion (i) changed preference for a high-cost, large-reward option to a low-cost, small-reward option, (ii) but not when the large-reward option was also low-cost or the small-reward option gave no reward, (iii) while increasing the latency in all the cases but only transiently, and (iv) that antagonism of either dopamine D1 or D2 receptors also specifically impaired selection of the high-cost, large-reward option. The underlying neural circuit mechanisms remain unclear. Here we show that findings i–iii can be explained by the dopaminergic representation of temporal-difference reward-prediction error (TD-RPE), whose mechanisms have now become clarified, if (1) the synaptic strengths storing the values of actions mildly decay in time and (2) the obtained-reward-representing excitatory input to dopamine neurons increases after dopamine depletion. The former is potentially caused by background neural activity–induced weak synaptic plasticity, and the latter is assumed to occur through post-depletion increase of neural activity in the pedunculopontine nucleus, where neurons representing obtained reward exist and presumably send excitatory projections to dopamine neurons. We further show that finding iv, which is nontrivial given the suggested distinct functions of the D1 and D2 corticostriatal pathways, can also be explained if we additionally assume a proposed mechanism of TD-RPE calculation, in which the D1 and D2 pathways encode the values of actions with a temporal difference. These results suggest a possible circuit mechanism for the involvements of dopamine in effort-related choices and, simultaneously, provide implications for the mechanisms of TD-RPE calculation.},

	abstract = {Movement is fundamental to human and animal life, emerging through interaction of complex neural, muscular, and skeletal systems. Study of movement draws from and contributes to diverse fields, including biology, neuroscience, mechanics, and robotics. OpenSim unites methods from these fields to create fast and accurate simulations of movement, enabling two fundamental tasks. First, the software can calculate variables that are difficult to measure experimentally, such as the forces generated by muscles and the stretch and recoil of tendons during movement. Second, OpenSim can predict novel movements from models of motor control, such as kinematic adaptations of human gait during loaded or inclined walking. Changes in musculoskeletal dynamics following surgery or due to human–device interaction can also be simulated; these simulations have played a vital role in several applications, including the design of implantable mechanical devices to improve human grasping in individuals with paralysis. OpenSim is an extensible and user-friendly software package built on decades of knowledge about computational modeling and simulation of biomechanical systems. OpenSim’s design enables computational scientists to create new state-of-the-art software tools and empowers others to use these tools in research and clinical applications.

A study of musculoskeletal parameters was conducted in two parts: (I) Empirical measurement of upper extremity musculoskeletal parameters. (II) Computational bootstrap simulation to examine statistical power of detecting optimal muscle length as a function of sarcomere length sample size and effect size. Methods. Parameters were determined with a cadaver model. Sarcomere lengths were measured for 120 samples per muscle using laser diffraction and the mean sarcomere length used to estimate optimal muscle length. A bootstrap computational simulation was conducted to estimate variance in mean sarcomere length as a function of sample size. Statistical power for detecting optimal muscle length as a function of sample size and effect size was then determined. Findings. Parameters are reported in tabular format. Power is 80\% at approximately 85, 50, 40 and 25 samples for effect sizes of 0.5, 0.75, 1.0 and 1.5 mm respectively. Interpretation. Musculoskeletal parameters for predicting muscle forces can be adequately measured in a cadaver model. Measurement of 40–60 sarcomere lengths per muscle is sufficient to calculate mean sarcomere length for estimating optimal muscle length with power of 80\% for an effect size of 0.75–1.0 mm.},

Purpose of this study is to reveal the relationship of muscular coordination of brachioradialis and biceps brachii during elbow flexion with respect to hand position and biomechanical advantages and disadvantages of biceps brachii. A group of 16 healthy subjects has been advised to perform 20 repetitions of single elbow flexion movements in different hand positions (pronated, neutral, and supinated). With a speed of 20°/s, simultaneously sEMG of biceps brachii and brachioradialis and kinematics of the movement were recorded in a motion analysis laboratory. Normalized to MVC the sEMG amplitudes of both muscles contributing to elbow flexion movements were compared in pronated, supinated, and neutral hand position over elbow joint angle. Significant differences in the contribution of brachioradialis were found in pronated hand position compared to supinated and neutral hand position while the muscular activity of biceps brachii shows no significant changes in any hand position. In conclusion, a statistical significant dependency of the inter-muscular coordination between biceps brachii and brachioradialis during elbow flexion with respect to hand position has been observed depending on a biomechanical disadvantage of biceps brachii.},

The results revealed that while the torque-length relationship displayed the classic inverted “U” pattern in both evoked and MVC conditions, the force-length relationship displayed a monotonically increasing pattern. Analyses of variance of the EMG data showed that there were no significant changes in the EMG amplitudes for the different joint angles during evoked or voluntary contractions. The result also showed that electrical stimulation can effectively isolated the torque-angle and force-length relationships of the biceps brachii and that the myoelectric signal during isometric contraction is uniform regardless of the length of the muscle or the joint angle.},

The purpose of this study was to develop a mathematical method to determine optimum muscle length and muscle stress based on the measurable physiological and biomechanical data. Design. The values of optimum muscle length and muscle stress are investigated. Background. Understanding the characteristics of muscle function in vivo is important for assisting the design of the tendon transfer and other rehabilitation procedures. In vivo determination of the physiological and anatomical parameters of muscle contraction is difficult but not impossible. Optimum muscle length and muscle stresses are important parameters for understanding muscle function. Methods. A Cybex dynamometer was used to measure isometric elbow flexion torque in eight different joint positions in seven subjects. Then the optimization method was used to determine optimum muscle length and muscle stress of three major elbow flexors, the biceps brachii, the brachialis, and the brachioradialis based on the model and joint torque data. Results. The calculated muscle stress for each subject was on average 109 N/cm2, while the optimum muscle length for the biceps brachii, the brachialis, and the brachioradialis was on average 14.05, 6.53, 17.24 cm, respectively. The joint angles corresponding to these optimum muscle lengths are 110°, 100° and 50° of elbow flexion, respectively. Conclusions. Optimum muscle length and muscle stress can be properly predicted using an analytical mathematical model along with an experimentally measured joint torque. Relevance The estimate of optimum muscle length is important for muscle modeling and tendon transfer surgery by taking advantage of length–tension relationship of individual muscles.},

	abstract = {Hand-transmitted vibration and the associated potential injuries are dependent on hand-arm posture, hand forces and other factors. This study presents biomechanical models consisting different substructures of the hand-arm system and the trunk of the body in different postures subject to zh-axis vibration. The trunk was considered in order to account for observed and reported considerable vibration at the shoulder and of the head. The models parameters were derived through error minimization using three different target biodynamic functions namely: driving-point mechanical impedance alone; localized vibration transmissibility responses alone; and combined simultaneously measured impedance and transmissibility responses. The results showed that the models’ parameters and responses are strongly dependent on the type of the target function. The models derived using impedance or transmissibility responses target function yield good comparisons with measured impedance or transmissibility responses, respectively, but none adequately characterize both the impedance and transmissibility responses. The models based on combined impedance and transmissibility target functions yield reasonably good comparisons with both measured biodynamic responses and characteristic frequencies. The results suggest that the transmissibility responses characterize the dynamics of the local tissues/muscles of the human hand-arm at different locations, while impedance characterizes the entire hand-arm system with emphasis around the driving-point. The results showed a strong coupling between the human hand-arm system and the whole-body. Relevance to industry Occupational exposure to hand-transmitted vibration has caused health problems in some operators of hand-held power tools. This has resulted in loss of manpower and costs in terms of compensations paid to affected workers. The existing International guidelines (ISO 5349-1, 2001) could not adequately predict some components of the hand-arm vibration syndrome due to lack of knowledge about hand-arm injury mechanism and probably due to neglect of the effect of posture adopted by workers in the assessment method. The biomechanical models for different postures presented in this study could be used to estimate distributed biodynamic responses (vibration power, dynamic forces, vibration intensity and deformation of joints) of the human hand-arm system exposed to vibration. Potential injury assessment based on these distributed biodynamic responses may yield better prediction of different components of the hand-arm injury and enhance understanding of injury mechanism.},

Influence of different modelling assumptions and approaches on model outputs are still not fully understood, while direct comparisons of standard approaches have been rarely undertaken. This study seeks to compare joint kinematics, joint kinetics and estimated muscle forces of two standard approaches offered in two different modelling environments (AnyBody, OpenSim). It is hypothesised that distinctive differences exist for individual muscles, while summing up synergists show general agreement. Experimental data of 10 healthy participants (28 ± 5 years, 1.72 ± 0.08 m, 69 ± 12 kg) was used for a standard static optimisation muscle force estimation routine in AnyBody and OpenSim while using two gait-specific musculoskeletal models. Statistical parameter mapping paired t-test was used to compare joint angle, moment and muscle force waveforms in Matlab. Results showed differences especially in sagittal ankle and hip angles as well as sagittal knee moments. Differences were also found for some of the muscles, especially of the triceps surae group and the biceps femoris short head, which occur as a result of different anthropometric and anatomical definitions (mass and inertia of segments, muscle properties) and scaling procedures (static vs. dynamic). Understanding these differences and their cause is crucial to operate such modelling environments in a clinical setting. Future research should focus on alternatives to classical generic musculoskeletal models (e.g. implementation of functional calibration tasks), while using experimental data reflecting normal and pathological gait to gain a better understanding of variations and divergent behaviour between approaches.},

We measured preferred walking speed on a 50-m section of level sidewalk and V˙o2max using a modified Balke treadmill protocol. Results: Walking was 11\% more expensive for the obese subjects, but they preferred to walk at similar speeds as normal weight subjects (1.40 vs. 1.47 m/s, p = 0.07). Both groups preferred walking speeds at which their gross energy cost per distance was almost minimized. Obese subjects had a smaller V˙o2max/kg, so they required a greater relative aerobic effort at the preferred speed (51\% vs. 36\%, p = 0.001). Discussion: Obese women preferred a walking speed that minimized energy cost per distance, even though this strategy required a greater relative aerobic effort than walking more slowly. Our results suggest that walking slower for a set distance may be an appropriate exercise recommendation for a weight management prescription in obese adults.},

	abstract = {People generally select a similar speed for a given motor task, such as reaching for a cup. One well established determinant of movement time is the speed–accuracy trade-off: movement time increases with the accuracy requirement. A second possible determinant is the energetic cost of making a movement. Parkinson's disease (PD), a condition characterized by generalized movement slowing (bradykinesia), provides the opportunity to directly explore this second possibility. We compared reaching movements of patients with PD with those of control subjects in a speed–accuracy trade-off task comprising conditions of increasing difficulty. Subjects completed as many trials as necessary to make 20 movements within a required speed range (trials to criterion, Nc). Difficulty was reflected in endpoint accuracy and Nc. Patients were as accurate as control subjects in all conditions (i.e., PD did not affect the speed–accuracy trade-off). However, Nc was consistently higher in patients, indicating reluctance to move fast although accuracy was not compromised. Specifically, the dependence of Nc on movement energy cost (slope SN) was steeper in patients than in control subjects. This difference in SN suggests that bradykinesia represents an implicit decision not to move fast because of a shift in the cost/benefit ratio of the energy expenditure needed to move at normal speed. SN was less steep, but statistically significant, in control subjects, which demonstrates a role for energetic cost in the normal control of movement speed. We propose that, analogous to the established role of dopamine in explicit reward-seeking behavior, the dopaminergic projection to the striatum provides a signal for implicit “motor motivation.”},

	abstract = {The metabolic costs of animal movement have been studied extensively under laboratory conditions, although frequently these are a poor approximation of the costs of operating in the natural, heterogeneous environment. Construction of “energy landscapes,” which relate animal locality to the cost of transport, can clarify whether, to what extent, and how movement properties are attributable to environmental heterogeneity. Although behavioral responses to aspects of the energy landscape are well documented in some fields (notably, the selection of tailwinds by aerial migrants) and scales (typically large), the principles of the energy landscape extend across habitat types and spatial scales. We provide a brief synthesis of the mechanisms by which environmentally driven changes in the cost of transport can modulate the behavioral ecology of animal movement in different media, develop example cost functions for movement in heterogeneous environments, present methods for visualizing these energy landscapes, and derive specific predictions of expected outcomes from individual- to population- and species-level processes. Animals modulate a suite of movement parameters (e.g., route, speed, timing of movement, and tortuosity) in relation to the energy landscape, with the nature of their response being related to the energy savings available. Overall, variation in movement costs influences the quality of habitat patches and causes nonrandom movement of individuals between them. This can provide spatial and/or temporal structure to a range of population- and species-level processes, ultimately including gene flow. Advances in animal-attached technology and geographic information systems are opening up new avenues for measuring and mapping energy landscapes that are likely to provide new insight into their influence in animal ecology.},

	abstract = {Summary People prefer to move in ways that minimize their energetic cost [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. For example, people tend to walk at a speed that minimizes energy use per unit distance [5, 6, 7, 8] and, for that speed, they select a step frequency that makes walking less costly [3, 4, 6, 10, 11, 12]. Although aspects of this preference appear to be established over both evolutionary [9, 13, 14, 15] and developmental [16] timescales, it remains unclear whether people can also optimize energetic cost in real time. Here we show that during walking, people readily adapt established motor programs to minimize energy use. To accomplish this, we used robotic exoskeletons to shift people’s energetically optimal step frequency to frequencies higher and lower than normally preferred. In response, we found that subjects adapted their step frequency to converge on the new energetic optima within minutes and in response to relatively small savings in cost ({\textbackslash}textless5\%). When transiently perturbed from their new optimal gait, subjects relied on an updated prediction to rapidly re-converge within seconds. Our collective findings indicate that energetic cost is not just an outcome of movement, but also plays a central role in continuously shaping it.},

For our example of producing static force with a finger driven by seven muscles, computational geometry characterizes—in a complete way—the structure of feasible activation spaces as 3-dimensional polytopes embedded in 7-D. The feasible activation space for a given task is \_the\_ landscape where all neuromuscular learning, control, and performance must occur. This approach unifies current theories of neuromuscular control because the structure of feasible activation spaces can be separately approximated as either low-dimensional basis functions (synergies), high-dimensional joint probability distributions (Bayesian priors), or fitness landscapes (to optimize cost functions).},

	abstract = {How does the motor system choose the speed for any given movement? Many current models assume a process that finds the optimal balance between the costs of moving fast and the rewards of achieving the goal. Here, we show that such models also need to take into account a prior representation of preferred movement speed, which can be changed by prolonged practice. In a time-constrained reaching task, human participants made 25-cm reaching movements within 300, 500, 700, or 900 ms. They were then trained for 3 days to execute the movement at either the slowest (900-ms) or fastest (300-ms) speed. When retested on the 4th day, movements executed under all four time constraints were biased toward the speed of the trained movement. In addition, trial-to-trial variation in speed of the trained movement was significantly reduced. These findings are indicative of a use-dependent mechanism that biases the selection of speed. Reduced speed variability was also associated with reduced errors in movement amplitude for the fast training group, which generalized nearly fully to a new movement direction. In contrast, changes in perpendicular error were specific to the trained direction. In sum, our results suggest the existence of a relatively stable but modifiable prior of preferred movement speed that influences the choice of movement speed under a range of task constraints.},

In such tasks, subjects are asked to respond when they detect the onset of a stimulus; the dependent variable is RT. We present a cognitive model for one-choice RT tasks that uses a one-boundary diffusion process to represent the accumulation of stimulus information. When the accumulated evidence reaches a decision criterion, a response is initiated. This model is distinct in accounting for the RT distributions observed for one-choice RT tasks, which can have long tails that have not been accurately captured by earlier cognitive modeling approaches. We show that the model explains performance on a brightness-detection task (a “simple RT task”) and on a psychomotor vigilance test. The latter is used extensively to examine the clinical and behavioral effects of sleep deprivation. For the brightness-detection task, the model explains the behavior of RT distributions as a function of brightness. For the psychomotor vigilance test, it accounts for lapses in performance under conditions of sleep deprivation and for changes in the shapes of RT distributions over the course of sleep deprivation. The model also successfully maps the rate of accumulation of stimulus information onto independently derived predictions of alertness. The model is a unified, mechanistic account of one-choice RT under conditions of sleep deprivation.},

However, it has yet to be determined if the behavior to which people converge when exposed to a novel perturbation during locomotion is also energetically optimal. We address this issue in the context of adaptation to walking on a split-belt treadmill, which can impose a left-right asymmetry in step lengths. In response to this asymmetry, participants gradually adjust their foot placement to adopt steps of equal length. Here, we characterized metabolic, mechanical, and perceptual estimates of energetic cost associated with a range of asymmetries to determine whether symmetry is the energetically optimal strategy for walking on a split-belt treadmill. We found that taking steps of equal length did not minimize metabolic cost or mechanical cost. In addition, perceptual estimates of cost were not sensitive to changes in asymmetry. However, symmetry was identified as the optimal strategy when energetic cost was estimated from a composite metric that combined both metabolic and mechanical costs. These results suggest that adaptation may arise from optimization of a composite estimate of effort derived from feedback about the interaction between the body and environment.},

	abstract = {{\textbackslash}textlessp{\textbackslash}textgreaterIn everyday tasks such as walking and running, we exploit the work performed by external sources such as gravity to reduce the work performed by muscles. There has been considerable recent effort to design devices capable of performing mechanical work to improve walking function or reduce effort. The success of these devices relies on the user adapting their natural control strategies to take advantage of assistance provided by the device. Although locomotor adaptation is central to this process, the study of adaptation is often done using approaches that on the surface, seem to have little in common with the use of external assistance. Here, we show that one of the most common approaches for studying this process, which is adaptation to walking on a split-belt treadmill, can be understood from a perspective in which people learn to take advantage of mechanical work performed by the treadmill. During adaptation, people systematically adjust their step lengths, defined as the distance between the feet at heel strike, from one step to the next. Initially, the step length on the slow belt is longer than the step length on the fast belt, measured as a negative step length asymmetry, but people naturally reduce this asymmetry with practice. Here, we demonstrate that these modifications of step length asymmetry allow people to extract positive work from the treadmill belts to reduce the positive work performed by the legs and simultaneously reduce metabolic cost. Moreover, we show that walking with a positive step length asymmetry minimizes metabolic cost, and people prefer to walk in this manner when allowed to select their walking pattern. Together, our results suggest that split-belt adaptation can be interpreted as a process by which people learn to take advantage of mechanical work performed by an external device to improve walking economy.{\textbackslash}textless/p{\textbackslash}textgreater},

The relative importance of these two goals in determining the preferred gait pattern is not currently clear. We investigated the relationship between energetic cost and stability during downhill walking, a context in which gravitational energy will assist propulsion but may also reduce stability. We hypothesized that humans will not minimize energetic cost when walking downhill, but will instead prefer a gait pattern that increases stability. Simulations of a dynamic walking model were used to determine whether stable downhill gaits could be achieved using a simple control strategy. Experimentally, twelve healthy subjects walked downhill at 1.25m/s (0, 0.05, 0.10, and 0.15 gradients). For each slope, subjects performed normal and relaxed trials, in which they were instructed to reduce muscle activity and allow gravity to maximally assist their gait. We quantified energetic cost, stride timing, and leg muscle activity. In our model simulations, increase in slope reduced the required actuation but also decreased stability. Experimental subjects behaved more like the model when using the relaxed rather than the normal walking strategy; the relaxed strategy decreased energetic cost at the steeper slopes but increased stride period variability, an indicator of instability. These results indicate that subjects do not take optimal advantage of the propulsion provided by gravity to decrease energetic cost, but instead prefer a more stable and more costly gait pattern.},

We find that the resulting complete cross-bridge model is able to account reasonably well for both the isometric transient data observed when a muscle is subjected to a sudden change in length and for the relationship between the velocity of muscle contraction in vivo and the actomyosin ATPase activity in vitro. This model also illustrates the interrelationship between biochemical and physiological data necessary for the development of a complete cross-bridge model of muscle contraction.},

	abstract = {After committing to an action, a decision-maker can change their mind to revise the action. Such changes of mind can even occur when the stream of information that led to the action is curtailed at movement onset. This is explained by the time delays in sensory processing and motor planning which lead to a component at the end of the sensory stream that can only be processed after initiation. Such post-initiation processing can explain the pattern of changes of mind by asserting an accumulation of additional evidence to a criterion level, termed change-of-mind bound. Here we test the hypothesis that physical effort associated with the movement required to change one's mind affects the level of the change-of-mind bound and the time for post-initiation deliberation. We varied the effort required to change from one choice target to another in a reaching movement by varying the geometry of the choice targets or by applying a force field between the targets. We show that there is a reduction in the frequency of change of mind when the separation of the choice targets would require a larger excursion of the hand from the initial to the opposite choice. The reduction is best explained by an increase in the evidence required for changes of mind and a reduced time period of integration after the initial decision. Thus the criteria to revise an initial choice is sensitive to energetic costs.},

	abstract = {Three structurally different types of models have evolved over the years to describe muscle-joint systems. The first, based on an input-output analysis of a given task, results in a simple second-order differential equation description that is adequate over a certain movement operating range. The second, based on the classic structural model of Hill (1938), results in a higher-order nonlinear model described by ordinary differential equations. The third, based on an analysis of the biophysical contractile mechanism, results in a complex partial differential equation description. The advantages and disadvantages of each type of model are considered, based on the criteria of identifying the simplest model that can adequately simulate any fundamental type of human movement without modifying model parameters for different tasks. It is shown that an eighth-order Hill-based antagonistic muscle-joint model is able to satisfy these criteria for a given joint if each of the four basic mechanicallysignificant non-linearities of the system are included in the model. This same model structure has been used successfully for eight different muscle-joint systems, ranging in size from knee flexion-extension to eye rotation - the only difference between the models is in the parameter values. Second-order models are shown to be task-specific special cases of the input-output behavior of the eighth-order model, while the more complex biophysical models are hypothesized to have insignificant advantages and many disadvantages over the Hill-based model during normal human movement.},

Compared to reward, however, effort remains poorly understood, both at the behavioral and neurophysiological levels. This is important because unwillingness to overcome effort to gain reward is a common feature of many neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders. A recent surge in interest in the neurobiological basis of effort has led to seemingly conflicting results regarding the role of dopamine. We argue here that, upon closer examination, there is actually striking consensus across studies: dopamine primarily codes for future reward but is less sensitive to anticipated effort cost. This strong association between dopamine and the incentive effects of rewards places dopamine in a key position to promote reward-directed action.},

	abstract = {We find that at 6 degrees C in the presence of 4 mM MgPPi, at low or moderate ionic strength, skinned rabbit psoas fibers exhibit a stiffness and an equatorial x-ray diffraction pattern similar to that of rigor fibers. As the ionic strength is increased in the absence of Ca2+, both the stiffness and the equatorial x-ray diffraction pattern approach those of the relaxed state. This suggests that, as in solution, increasing ionic strength weakens the affinity of myosin cross-bridges for actin, which results in a decrease in the number of cross-bridges attached. The effect is Ca2+-sensitive. Assuming that stiffness is a measure of the number of cross-bridge heads attached, in the absence of Ca2+, the fraction of attached cross-bridge heads varies from approximately 75\% to approximately 25\% over an ionic strength range where ionic strength in solution weakens the binding constant for myosin subfragment-1 binding to unregulated actin by less than a factor of 3. Therefore, this phenomenon appears similar to the cooperative Ca2+-sensitive binding of S1 to regulated actin in solution (Greene, L. E., and E. Eisenberg, 1980, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 77:2616). By comparing the binding constants in solution and in the fiber under similar conditions, we find that the "effective actin concentration," that is, the concentration that gives the same fraction of S1 molecules bound to actin in solution as cross-bridge heads are bound to actin in a fiber, is in the millimolar range.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.13041},
	abstract = {Using joint actuators to drive the skeletal movements is a common practice in character animation, but the resultant torque patterns are often unnatural or infeasible for real humans to achieve. On the other hand, physiologically-based models explicitly simulate muscles and tendons and thus produce more human-like movements and torque patterns. This paper introduces a technique to transform an optimal control problem formulated in the muscle-actuation space to an equivalent problem in the joint-actuation space, such that the solutions to both problems have the same optimal value. By solving the equivalent problem in the joint-actuation space, we can generate human-like motions comparable to those generated by musculotendon models, while retaining the benefit of simple modeling and fast computation offered by joint-actuation models. Our method transforms constant bounds on muscle activations to nonlinear, state-dependent torque limits in the joint-actuation space. In addition, the metabolic energy function on muscle activations is transformed to a nonlinear function of joint torques, joint configuration and joint velocity. Our technique can also benefit policy optimization using deep reinforcement learning approach, by providing a more anatomically realistic action space for the agent to explore during the learning process. We take the advantage of the physiologically-based simulator, OpenSim, to provide training data for learning the torque limits and the metabolic energy function. Once trained, the same torque limits and the energy function can be applied to drastically different motor tasks formulated as either trajectory optimization or policy learning.},

The theoretical framework put forth by our methodology computes all the necessary Jacobians for control, even with the drastically increased dimensionality of the state descriptors associated with three-dimensional, volumetric muscles. The direct coupling of volumetric actuators in the controller allows us to model muscular deficiencies that manifest in shape and geometry, in ways that cannot be captured with line-segment approximations.

	abstract = {Muscle-driven simulations of human and animal motion are widely used to complement physical experiments for studying movement dynamics. Musculotendon models are an essential component of muscle-driven simulations, yet neither the computational speed nor the biological accuracy of the simulated forces has been adequately evaluated. Here we compare the speed and accuracy of three musculotendon models: two with an elastic tendon (an equilibrium model and a damped equilibrium model) and one with a rigid tendon. Our simulation benchmarks demonstrate that the equilibrium and damped equilibrium models produce similar force profiles but have different computational speeds. At low activation, the damped equilibrium model is 29 times faster than the equilibrium model when using an explicit integrator and 3 times faster when using an implicit integrator; at high activation, the two models have similar simulation speeds. In the special case of simulating a muscle with a short tendon, the rigid-tendon model produces forces that match those generated by the elastic-tendon models, but simulates 2–54 times faster when an explicit integrator is used and 6–31 times faster when an implicit integrator is used. The equilibrium, damped equilibrium, and rigid-tendon models reproduce forces generated by maximally-activated biological muscle with mean absolute errors less than 8.9\%, 8.9\%, and 20.9\% of the maximum isometric muscle force, respectively. When compared to forces generated by submaximally-activated biological muscle, the forces produced by the equilibrium, damped equilibrium, and rigid-tendon models have mean absolute errors less than 16.2\%, 16.4\%, and 18.5\%, respectively. To encourage further development of musculotendon models, we provide implementations of each of these models in OpenSim version 3.1 and benchmark data online, enabling others to reproduce our results and test their models of musculotendon dynamics.},

	abstract = {The aim of this study was to compare muscle-force estimates derived for human locomotion using three different methods commonly reported in the literature: static optimisation (SO), computed muscle control (CMC) and neuromusculoskeletal tracking (NMT). In contrast with SO, CMC and NMT calculate muscle forces dynamically by including muscle activation dynamics. Furthermore, NMT utilises a time-dependent performance criterion, wherein a single optimisation problem is solved over the entire time interval of the task. Each of these methods was used in conjunction with musculoskeletal modelling and experimental gait data to determine lower-limb muscle forces for self-selected speeds of walking and running. Correlation analyses were performed for each muscle to quantify differences between the various muscle-force solutions. The patterns of muscle loading predicted by the three methods were similar for both walking and running. The correlation coefficient between any two sets of muscle-force solutions ranged from 0.46 to 0.99 (p {\textbackslash}textless 0.001 for all muscles). These results suggest that the robustness and efficiency of static optimisation make it the most attractive method for estimating muscle forces in human locomotion.},

Data from individual children, young adults, and older adults who participated in two previous studies were analyzed [Green, L., Fry, A.F., Myerson, J., 1994. Discounting of delayed rewards: a life-span comparison. Psychol. Sci. 5, 33–36; Green, L., Myerson, J., Lichtman, D., Rosen, S., Fry, A., 1996. Temporal discounting in choice between delayed rewards: the role of age and income. Psychol. Aging 11, 79–84]. At all ages, a hyperbola-like function originally proposed by Green et al. (1994) based on group data, provided the best description of individual discounting functions. Two developmental trends were observed. The rate at which individuals discounted the value of delayed rewards decreased with age, and there was a systematic change in the shape of the discounting function. Each of these trends was reflected in a separate parameter of the model. The fact that the same mathematical model described the behavior of individuals of different ages suggests that age and individual differences in the discounting of delayed rewards are primarily quantitative in nature and reflect variations on fundamentally similar choice processes.},

	abstract = {During value-based decision-making, individuals consider the various options and select the one that provides the maximum subjective value. Although the brain integrates abstract information to compute and compare these values, the only behavioral outcome is often the decision itself. However, if the options are visual stimuli, during deliberation the brain moves the eyes from one stimulus to the other. Previous work suggests that saccade vigor, i.e., peak velocity as a function of amplitude, is greater if reward is associated with the visual stimulus. This raises the possibility that vigor during the free viewing of options may be influenced by the valuation of each option. Here, humans chose between a small, immediate monetary reward and a larger but delayed reward. As the deliberation began, vigor was similar for the saccades made to the two options but diverged 0.5 s before decision time, becoming greater for the preferred option. This difference in vigor increased as a function of the difference in the subjective values that the participant assigned to the delayed and immediate options. After the decision was made, participants continued to gaze at the options, but with reduced vigor, making it possible to infer timing of the decision from the sudden drop in vigor. Therefore, the subjective value that the brain assigned to a stimulus during decision-making affected the motor system via the vigor with which the eyes moved toward that stimulus., SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT We find that, as individuals deliberate between two rewarding options and arrive at a decision, the vigor with which they make saccades to each option reflects a real-time evaluation of that option. With deliberation, saccade vigor diverges between the two options, becoming greater for the option that the individual will eventually choose. The results suggest a shared element between the network that assigns value to a stimulus during the process of decision-making and the network that controls vigor of movements toward that stimulus.},

Suppose that the purpose of any movement is to position our body in a more rewarding state. People and other animals discount future reward as a hyperbolic function of time. Here, we show that across populations of people and monkeys there is a correlation between discounting of reward and control of movements. We consider saccadic eye movements and hypothesize that duration of a movement is equivalent to a delay of reward. The hyperbolic cost of this delay not only accounts for kinematics of saccades in adults, it also accounts for the faster saccades of children, who temporally discount reward more steeply. Our theory explains why saccade velocities increase when reward is elevated, and why disorders in the encoding of reward, for example in Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia, produce changes in saccade. We show that delay of reward elevates the cost of saccades, reducing velocities. Finally, we consider coordinated movements that include motion of eyes and head and find that their kinematics is also consistent with a hyperbolic, reward-dependent cost of time. Therefore, each voluntary movement carries a cost because its duration delays acquisition of reward. The cost depends on the value that the brain assigns to stimuli, and the rate at which it discounts this value in time. The motor commands that move our eyes reflect this cost of time.},

Analyses of the behavior of individual young adults demonstrated that temporal discounting is better described by hyperbola-like functions than by exponential decay functions. For most individuals, the parameter that determines the rate of discounting varied inversely with amount. Raising the denominator of the discounting function to a power resulted in better descriptions of the data from most subjects. Two possible derivations of the temporal discounting function are proposed, a repeated choice model and an expected value model.

Different images might have different intrinsic values. Optimal control theory predicts that the intrinsic value that the brain assigns to targets of saccades should be reflected in the trajectory of the saccade. That is, in anticipation of foveating a highly valued image, our brain should produce a saccade with a higher velocity and shorter duration. Here, we considered four types of images: faces, objects, inverted faces, and meaningless visual noise. Indeed, we found that reflexive saccades that were made to a laser light in anticipation of viewing an image of a face had the highest velocities and shortest durations. The intrinsic value of visual information appears to have a small but significant influence on the motor commands that guide saccades.},

Here we addressed this issue by employing a conditional saccade task, in which human subjects performed a series of non-reflexive, visually-guided horizontal saccades. The subjects were (or were not) financially compensated for making a saccade in response to a centrally-displayed visual congruent (or incongruent) stimulus. Reward modulation of saccadic velocities was quantified independently of the amplitude-velocity coupling. We found that reward expectation significantly sped up voluntary saccades up to 30°/s, and the reward modulation was consistent across tests. These findings suggest that monetary reward speeds up saccades in human in a fashion analogous to how juice reward sped up saccades in monkeys. We further noticed that the idiosyncratic nasal-temporal velocity asymmetry was highly consistent regardless of test order, and its magnitude was not correlated with the magnitude of reward modulation. This suggests that reward modulation and the intrinsic velocity asymmetry may be governed by separate mechanisms that regulate saccade generation.},

To explore the mechanisms underlying such reward-oriented behavior, we devised a memory-guided saccade task in which only one fixed direction out of four was rewarded, which was called the one-direction-rewarded task (1DR). As the rewarded direction was changed in four blocks, saccades in a given direction were rewarded in one block (constituting reward-oriented behavior), but non-rewarded in the other blocks (non-reward-oriented behavior). As a control, an all-directions-rewarded task (ADR) was used. Using these tasks, we found that the parameters of saccades changed depending on whether or not the saccade was followed by reward. (1) The mean saccadic peak velocity was higher and the mean saccade latency was shorter in the rewarded condition than in the non-rewarded condition. (2) The mean saccade amplitude showed no difference in two out of three monkeys. (3) The variations of saccadic velocity, latency and amplitude were smaller in the rewarded condition. (4) Within a block of 1DR, the saccade velocity remained high in the rewarded condition, but decreased gradually in the non-rewarded condition; it decreased only slightly in ADR. The saccade latency showed the opposite pattern of change, but less clearly. (5) The saccades in the non-rewarded condition tended to have slower velocities and longer latencies in the trials shortly after a rewarded trial. (6) The ratio of error trials was much higher in the non-rewarded condition than the rewarded condition. (7) The errors, which were due to premature or incorrect saccades, showed unique spatiotemporal patterns that would reflect the competition between the cognitive and motivational processes. These results provide important constraints to the neuronal mechanism underlying reward-oriented behavior because it must satisfy these rules.},

Is there a relationship between cost of time in decision making and cost of time in control of movements? Our theory predicts that people who are more impulsive should in general move faster than subjects who are less impulsive. To test our idea, we considered elementary voluntary movements: saccades of the eye. We found that in humans, saccadic vigor, assessed using velocity as a function of amplitude, was as much as 50\% greater in one subject than another; that is, some people consistently moved their eyes with high vigor. We measured the cost of time in a decision-making task in which the same subjects were given a choice between smaller odds of success immediately and better odds if they waited. We measured how long they were willing to wait to obtain the better odds and how much they increased their wait period after they failed. We found that people that exhibited greater vigor in their movements tended to have a steep temporal discount function, as evidenced by their waiting patterns in the decision-making task.

Man-made motion sensors have also been widely applied for a broad array of biomedical applications including diagnosis of balance disorders and evaluation of energy expenditure. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art sensing components utilized for body motion measurement. The anatomy and working principles of a natural body motion sensor, the human vestibular system, are first described. Various man-made inertial sensors are then elaborated based on their distinctive sensing mechanisms. In particular, both the conventional solid-state motion sensors and the emerging non solid-state motion sensors are depicted. With their lower cost and increased intelligence, man-made motion sensors are expected to play an increasingly important role in biomedical systems for basic research as well as clinical diagnostics.},

This type of monitoring is beneficial for therapists and physicians because it facilitates remote assessment of patient activities. In our approach, two IMUs are mounted on the upper leg and the lower leg to measure the Euler angles of each segment. The Euler angles are sent via Bluetooth protocols to a pc for calculating the knee joint angle. In our experiments, we utilized a motion capture system to accurately measure the knee joint angle and used this as the ground truth to assess the accuracy of the IMU system. The range of average error of the system across a variety of motion trials was 0.08 to 3.06 degrees. In summary, the accuracy of the IMU measurement system currently outperforms existing wearable systems such as conductive fiber optic sensors and flex-sensors.},

Maximum hip extension and the ankle plantar flexion were significantly reduced. Kinetic gait parameters showed reduced push-off ankle power and lift-off hip power generation. Strong correlations between these important body advancement mechanisms and the walking velocity were observed.

The magnitude of the first adduction torque peak in particular is strongly associated with knee OA progression. While toeing out has been shown to reduce the second peak, no clinically realistic gait modifications have been identified that effectively reduce both peaks simultaneously. This study predicts novel patient-specific gait modifications that achieve this goal without changing the foot path. The modified gait motion was designed for a single patient with knee OA using dynamic optimization of a patient-specific, full-body gait model. The cost function minimized the knee adduction torque subject to constraints limiting how much the new gait motion could deviate from the patient's normal gait motion. The optimizations predicted a “medial-thrust” gait pattern that reduced the first adduction torque peak between 32\% and 54\% and the second peak between 34\% and 56\%. The new motion involved three synergistic kinematic changes: slightly decreased pelvis obliquity, slightly increased leg flexion, and slightly increased pelvis axial rotation. After gait retraining, the patient achieved adduction torque reductions of 39\% to 50\% in the first peak and 37\% to 55\% in the second one. These reductions are comparable to those reported after high tibial osteotomy surgery. The associated kinematic changes were consistent with the predictions except for pelvis obliquity, which showed little change. This study demonstrates that it is feasible to design novel patient-specific gait modifications with potential clinical benefit using dynamic optimization of patient-specific, full-body gait models. Further investigation is needed to assess the extent to which similar gait modifications may be effective for other patients with knee OA.},

	abstract = {Pathological movement patterns like crouch gait are characterized by abnormal kinematics and muscle activations that alter how muscles support the body weight during walking. Individual muscles are often the target of interventions to improve crouch gait, yet the roles of individual muscles during crouch gait remain unknown. The goal of this study was to examine how muscles contribute to mass center accelerations and joint angular accelerations during single-limb stance in crouch gait, and compare these contributions to unimpaired gait. Subject-specific dynamic simulations were created for ten children who walked in a mild crouch gait and had no previous surgeries. The simulations were analyzed to determine the acceleration of the mass center and angular accelerations of the hip, knee, and ankle generated by individual muscles. The results of this analysis indicate that children walking in crouch gait have less passive skeletal support of body weight and utilize substantially higher muscle forces to walk than unimpaired individuals. Crouch gait relies on the same muscles as unimpaired gait to accelerate the mass center upward, including the soleus, vasti, gastrocnemius, gluteus medius, rectus femoris, and gluteus maximus. However, during crouch gait, these muscles are active throughout single-limb stance, in contrast to the modulation of muscle forces seen during single-limb stance in an unimpaired gait. Subjects walking in crouch gait rely more on proximal muscles, including the gluteus medius and hamstrings, to accelerate the mass center forward during single-limb stance than subjects with an unimpaired gait.},

	abstract = {Objective To investigate how the combination of seat pan inclination and friction coefficient influences the internal forces in the seated human body. Background The focus on the ergonomics of sitting is increasing with the amount of time spent in a seated posture. A generic computer model of a chair has been developed and together with a detailed full-body musculoskeletal model it forms a new basis for investigation and understanding of the biomechanics of the seated human. Method The analysis based on inverse dynamics and a minimum fatigue criterion is used for solving the redundancy problem of the muscles. The input to the analysis is different combinations of seat pan inclination and friction coefficient; the output is the individual muscle activities and spinal joint forces. Results The computational investigations show that seat pan inclination and friction coefficient have a complex combined influence on muscle activity and spinal joint forces. Forward seat pan inclination appears to cause muscle fatigue unless sufficient friction is present, and in this case loses much of its beneficial effect for the spinal joint loads and leads to tissue shear forces that may be uncomfortable or even harmful. Conclusion A generic chair model has been developed; the model can be adjusted in numerous ways. The chair together with a full body musculoskeletal model forms an efficient tool, which can be used in the design process of new chairs for quantifying the consequences of various design choices. It seems difficult to combine the desire for relaxation with the desire for minimum spinal loads. Relevance to industry Detailed biomechanical modeling is a promising tool for furniture design, workplace design and indeed for improvement of occupational health.},

	abstract = {One objective of this study was to investigate whether neuromuscular quantities were associated with preferred pedaling rate selection during submaximal steady-state cycling from a theoretical perspective using a musculoskeletal model with an optimal control analysis. Specific neuromuscular quantities of interest were the individual muscle activation, force, stress and endurance. To achieve this objective, a forward dynamic model of cycling and optimization framework were used to simulate pedaling at three different rates of 75, 90 and 105rpm at 265W. The pedaling simulations were produced by optimizing the individual muscle excitation timing and magnitude to reproduce experimentally collected data. The results from these pedaling simulations indicated that all neuromuscular quantities were minimized at 90rpm when summed across muscles. In the context of endurance cycling, these results suggest that minimizing neuromuscular fatigue is an important mechanism in pedaling rate selection. A second objective was to determine whether any of these quantities could be used to predict the preferred pedaling rate. By using the quantities with the strongest quadratic trends as the performance criterion to be minimized in an optimal control analysis, these quantities were analyzed to assess whether they could be further minimized at 90rpm and produce normal pedaling mechanics. The results showed that both the integrated muscle activation and average endurance summed across all muscles could be further minimized at 90rpm indicating that these quantities cannot be used individually to predict preferred pedaling rates.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the question of whether maximal vertical jump height depends on initial jumping posture. A direct dynamics computer simulation approach was used to avoid subject preference and practice effects. The human body was modeled as four rigid segments connected by ideal hinge joints, with movement constrained to the sagittal plane and driven by three single-joint torque actuators. Maximal height jumps were found for each of 125 differnet intial postures. For each initial posture, the optimal pattern of joint torque actuator onset times was found using a multidimensional simplex algorithm searching for maximal jump height. The model results revealed that maximal jump height is relatively insensitive to initial posture, but that the pattern of joint torque onset times necessary to effect these optimal heights varies considerably. Model kinematics indicate that the variability in onset times is necessary to allow the body to re-orient itself in different ways during the downward countermovement phase. This variable re-orientation strategy is followed by a more stereotyped upward thrust phase that is similar despite the differences in starting postures. Model center of mass, joint and segmental kinematics show many features found in experimental studies of jumping, despite the exclusive use of single joint torque actuators. However, a proximal-to-distal sequence of joint coordination was not found, possibly because of the omission of antagonist and bi-articular muscles. The results suggest that similar vertical jump heights should be obtained using a wide range of initial starting positions.},

To understand how muscles contribute to propulsion (i.e., forward acceleration of the mass center) and support (i.e., upward acceleration of the mass center) during running we developed a three-dimensional muscle-actuated simulation of the running gait cycle. The simulation is driven by 92 musculotendon actuators of the lower extremities and torso and includes the dynamics of arm motion. We analyzed the simulation to determine how each muscle contributed to the acceleration of the body mass center. During the early part of the stance phase, the quadriceps muscle group was the largest contributor to braking (i.e., backward acceleration of the mass center) and support. During the second half of the stance phase, the soleus and gastrocnemius muscles were the greatest contributors to propulsion and support. The arms did not contribute substantially to either propulsion or support, generating less than 1\% of the peak mass center acceleration. However, the arms effectively counterbalanced the vertical angular momentum of the lower extremities. Our analysis reveals that the quadriceps and plantarflexors are the major contributors to acceleration of the body mass center during running.},

The methods used in measuring the extra heat due to shortening have been critically examined and are described in some detail. The constant α of the heat of shortening depends on P, the load lifted, according to an average linear relation for frog sartorii at 0 degrees C, α /P0 = 0· 16(± 0· 015)+0· 18(± 0· 027)P/P0, P0 is the maximum force developed at constant length. The constant α of the heat of shortening can no longer be regarded as the same quantity as the constant a of the characteristic equation (P+a)v = b(P0-P), relating velocity (v) of shortening to load; but α /P0 and a/P0, being always of the same order of size, are almost certainly connected in some way. The original (Hill 1938) conclusion that α and a were the same was probably due to a persistent error in the measurement of α , making it about 30\% too great. In the original (Hill 1938) hypothesis the rate of extra energy liberation (P + α )v during shortening was taken to be proportional to (P0 - P), i.e. to the gap between the maximum force a muscle could exert and the actual load it had to lift. In its simple form this idea must be abandoned; but a modification is suggested which still provides the characteristic equation and supplies a connexion between α and a. The assumptions made in calculating the heat of shortening are examined; to regard it simply as a change, produced by shortening, in the maintenance heat would make little difference. Further advances in the chemistry of contraction may allow the facts to be expressed in more concrete terms.},

Viewing double support as a transition from one inverted pendulum to the next, we hypothesized that the leading leg performs negative work to redirect the center of mass velocity, while simultaneously, the trailing leg performs positive work to replace the lost energy. To test this hypothesis, we developed a method to quantify the external mechanical work performed by each limb (individual limbs method). Traditional measures of external mechanical work use the sum of the ground reaction forces acting on the limbs (combined limbs method) allowing for the mathematical cancellation of simultaneous positive and negative work during multiple support periods. We expected to find that the traditional combined limbs method underestimates external mechanical work by a substantial amount. We used both methods to measure the external mechanical work performed by humans walking over a range of speeds. We found that during double support, the legs perform a substantial amount of positive and negative external work simultaneously. The combined limbs measures of positive and negative external work were approximately 33\% less than those calculated using the individual limbs method. At all speeds, the trailing leg performs greater than 97\% of the double support positive work while the leading leg performs greater than 94\% of the double support negative work.},

	abstract = {Skeletal muscle contracts either by shortening or lengthening (concentrically or eccentrically, respectively); however, the two contractions substantially differ from one another in terms of mechanisms of force generation, maximum force production and energy cost. It is generally known that eccentric actions generate greater force than isometric and concentric contractions and at a lower metabolic cost. Hence, by virtue of the greater mechanical loading involved in active lengthening, eccentric resistance training (ECC RT) is assumed to produce greater hypertrophy than concentric resistance training (CON RT). Nonetheless, prevalence of either ECC RT or CON RT in inducing gains in muscle mass is still an open issue, with some studies reporting greater hypertrophy with eccentric, some with concentric and some with similar hypertrophy within both training modes. Recent observations suggest that such hypertrophic responses to lengthening vs. shortening contractions are achieved by different adaptations in muscle architecture. Whilst the changes in muscle protein synthesis in response to acute and chronic concentric and eccentric exercise bouts seem very similar, the molecular mechanisms regulating the myogenic adaptations to the two distinct loading stimuli are still incompletely understood., Thus, the present review aims to, (a) critically discuss the literature on the contribution of eccentric vs. concentric loading to muscular hypertrophy and structural remodeling, and, (b) clarify the molecular mechanisms that may regulate such adaptations., We conclude that, when matched for either maximum load or work, similar increase in muscle size is found between ECC and CON RT. However, such hypertrophic changes appear to be achieved through distinct structural adaptations, which may be regulated by different myogenic and molecular responses observed between lengthening and shortening contractions.},

	abstract = {Skip to Next Section This series of four papers investigates the link between the energetics and the mechanics of terrestrial locomotion. Two experimental variables are used throughout the study: speed and body size. Mass-specific metabolic rates of running animals can be varied by about tenfold using either variable. This first paper considers metabolic energy consumed during terrestrial locomotion. New data relating rate of oxygen consumption and speed are reported for: eight species of wild and domestic artiodactyls; seven species of carnivores; four species of primates; and one species of rodent. These are combined with previously published data to formulate a new allometric equation relating mass-specific rates of oxygen consumed (VO2/Mb) during locomotion at a constant speed to speed and body mass (based on data from 62 avian and mammalian species): VO2/Mb = 0.533 Mb-0.316.vg + 0.300 Mb-0.303 where VO2/Mb has the units ml O2 s-1 kg-1; Mb is in kg; and vg is in m s-1. This equation can be expressed in terms of mass-specific rates of energy consumption (Emetab/Mb) using the energetic equivalent of 1 ml O2 = 20.1 J because the contribution of anaerobic glycolysis was negligible: Emetab/Mb = 10.7 Mb-0.316.vg + 6.03 Mb-0.303 where Emetab/Mb has the units watts/kg. This new relationship applies equally well to bipeds and quadrupeds and differs little from the allometric equation reported 12 years ago by Taylor, Schmid-Nielsen \& Raab (1970). Ninety per cent of the values calculated from this genera equation for the diverse assortment of avian and mammalian species included in this regression fall within 25\% of the observed values at the middle of the speed range where measurements were made. This agreement is impressive when one considers that mass-specific rates of oxygen consumption differed by more than 1400\% over this size range of animals.},

The mechanical power spent to accelerate the limbs relative to the trunk in level walking and running, Ẇint, has been measured at various `constant' speeds (3-33 km/hr) with the cinematographic procedure used by Fenn (1930a) at high speeds of running., 2. Ẇint increases approximately as the square of the speed of walking and running. For a given speed Ẇint is greater in walking than in running., 3. In walking above 3 km/hr, Ẇint is greater than the power spent to accelerate and lift the centre of mass of the body at each step, Ẇext (measured by Cavagna, Thys \& Zamboni, 1976b). In running Ẇint {\textbackslash}textless Ẇext up to about 20 km/hr, whereas at higher speeds Ẇint {\textbackslash}textgreater Ẇext., 4. The total work done by the muscles was calculated as Wtot = ǀWintǀ + ǀWextǀ. Except that at the highest speeds of walking, the total work done per unit distance Wtot/km is greater in running than in walking., 5. The efficiency of positive work was measured from the ratio Wtot/Net energy expenditure: this is greater than 0·25 indicating that both in walking and in running the muscles utilize, during shortening, some energy stored during a previous phase of negative work (stretching)., 6. In walking the efficiency reaches a maximum (0·35-0·40) at intermediate speeds, as may be expected from the properties of the contractile component of muscle. In running the efficiency increases steadily with speed (from 0·45 to 0·70-0·80) suggesting that positive work derives mainly from the passive recoil of muscle elastic elements and to a lesser extent from the active shortening of the contractile machinery. These findings are consistent with the different mechanics of the two exercises.},

	abstract = {The robustness of motor outputs to muscle dysfunction has been investigated using musculoskeletal modeling, but with conflicting results owing to differences in model complexity and motor tasks. Our objective was to systematically study how the number of kinematic degrees of freedom, and the number of independent muscle actuators alter the robustness of motor output to muscle dysfunction. We took a detailed musculoskeletal model of the human leg and systematically varied the model complexity to create six models with either 3 or 7 kinematic degrees of freedom and either 14, 26, or 43 muscle actuators. We tested the redundancy of each model by quantifying the reduction in sagittal plane feasible force set area when a single muscle was removed. The robustness of feasible force set area to the loss of any single muscle, i.e. general single muscle loss increased with the number of independent muscles and decreased with the number of kinematic degrees of freedom, with the robust area varying from 1\% and 52\% of the intact feasible force set area. The maximum sensitivity of the feasible force set to the loss of any single muscle varied from 75\% to 26\% of the intact feasible force set area as the number of muscles increased. Additionally, the ranges of feasible muscle activation for maximum force production were largely unconstrained in many cases, indicating ample musculoskeletal redundancy even for maximal forces. We propose that ratio of muscles to kinematic degrees of freedom can be used as a rule of thumb for estimating musculoskeletal redundancy in both simulated and real biomechanical systems.},

	abstract = {The movements studied involved moving the tip of a pointer attached to the hand from a given starting point to a given end point in a horizontal plane. Three joints — the shoulder, elbow and wrist —were free to move. Thus the system represented a redundant manipulator. The coordination of the movements of the three joints was recorded and analyzed. The study concerned how the joints are controlled during a movement. The results are used to evaluate several current hypotheses for motor control. Basically, the incremental changes are calculated so as to move the tip of the manipulator along a straight line in the workspace. The values of the individual joints seem to be determined as follows. Starting from the initial values the incremental changes in the three joint angles represent a compromise between two criteria: 1) the amount of the angular change should be about the same in the three joints, and 2) the angular changes should minimize the total cost of the arm position as determined by cost functions defined for each joint as a function of angle. By itself, this mechanism would produce strongly curved trajectories in joint space which could include additional acceleration and deceleration in a joint. These are reduced by the influence of a third criterion which fits with the mass-spring hypothesis. Thus the path is calculated as a compromise between a straight line in workspace and a straight line in joint space. The latter can produce curved paths in the workspace such as were actually found in the experiments. A model calculation shows that these hypotheses can qualitatively describe the experimental findings.},

	abstract = {The metabolic cost of walking is determined by many mechanical tasks, but the individual contribution of each task remains unclear. We hypothesized that the force generated to support body weight and the work performed to redirect and accelerate body mass each individually incur a significant metabolic cost during normal walking. To test our hypothesis, we measured changes in metabolic rate in response to combinations of simulated reduced gravity and added loading. We found that reducing body weight by simulating reduced gravity modestly decreased net metabolic rate. By calculating the metabolic cost per Newton of reduced body weight, we deduced that generating force to support body weight comprises ∼28\% of the metabolic cost of normal walking. Similar to previous loading studies, we found that adding both weight and mass increased net metabolic rate in more than direct proportion to load. However, when we added mass alone by using a combination of simulated reduced gravity and added load, net metabolic rate increased about one-half as much as when we added both weight and mass. By calculating the cost per kilogram of added mass, we deduced that the work performed on the center of mass comprises ∼45\% of the metabolic cost of normal walking. Our findings support the hypothesis that force and work each incur a significant metabolic cost. Specifically, the cost of performing work to redirect and accelerate the center of mass is almost twice as great as the cost of generating force to support body weight.},

	abstract = {We often have to adapt our movements as we interact with a variety of objects in various conditions on a daily basis. Evidence suggests that motor adaptation relies on a process that minimizes error and effort; however, much of this evidence involved adapting to novel dynamics with physical perturbations to counteract. To examine the generality of the process of minimizing error and effort during motor adaptation, we used a visuomotor adaptation task that did not involve dynamic perturbations. We investigated the time courses of muscle activity, coactivation, and metabolic cost as subjects reached to a target with a visuomotor rotation. We wanted to determine whether subjects would modulate muscle activity, coactivation, and metabolic cost during a visuomotor adaptation task. Interestingly, subjects increased muscle coactivation early during visuomotor adaptation when there were large cursor-trajectory errors but no physical perturbations to reject. As adaptation progressed, muscle activity and coactivation decreased. Metabolic cost followed a similar time course. When the perturbation was removed, typical after-effects were observed: trajectory error increased and then was reduced quickly. This was accompanied by increases in muscle activity, coactivation, and metabolic cost, along with subsequent rapid reductions. These results demonstrate that subjects modulate muscle activity, coactivation, and metabolic cost similarly across different forms of motor adaptation. Overall, our findings suggest that minimization of error and effort may be a general process underlying various forms of motor adaptation.},

Age-related sensorimotor changes and increased muscle coactivation likely alter the trial-and-error-based process of adapting to new movement demands (motor adaptation). Here, we asked, to what extent is motor adaptation to novel dynamics maintained in older adults (≥65 yr)? We hypothesized that older adults would adapt to the novel dynamics less well than young adults. Because older adults often use muscle coactivation, we expected older adults to use greater muscle coactivation during motor adaptation than young adults. Nevertheless, we predicted that older adults would reduce muscle activity and metabolic cost with motor adaptation, similar to young adults. Seated older (n = 11, 73.8 ± 5.6 yr) and young (n = 15, 23.8 ± 4.7 yr) adults made targeted reaching movements while grasping a robotic arm. We measured their metabolic rate continuously via expired gas analysis. A force field was used to add novel dynamics. Older adults had greater movement deviations and compensated for just 65\% of the novel dynamics compared with 84\% in young adults. As expected, older adults used greater muscle coactivation than young adults. Last, older adults reduced muscle activity with motor adaptation and had consistent reductions in metabolic cost later during motor adaptation, similar to young adults. These results suggest that despite increased muscle coactivation, older adults can adapt to the novel dynamics, albeit less accurately. These results also suggest that reductions in metabolic cost may be a fundamental feature of motor adaptation.},

We estimated mechanical costs from individual limb external mechanical work and metabolic costs using open circuit respirometry. The mechanical and metabolic costs both increased substantially (54 and 45\%, respectively) for widths greater than the preferred value (0.15-0.45L) and with step width squared (R(2) = 0.91 and 0.83, respectively). As predicted by a three-dimensional model of walking mechanics, the increases in these costs appear to be a result of the mechanical work required for redirecting the centre of mass velocity during the transition between single stance phases (step-to-step transition costs). The metabolic cost for steps narrower than preferred (0.10-0.00L) increased by 8\%, which was probably as a result of the added cost of moving the swing leg laterally in order to avoid the stance leg (lateral limb swing cost). Trade-offs between the step-to-step transition and lateral limb swing costs resulted in a minimum metabolic cost at a step width of 0.12L, which is not significantly different from foot width (0.11L) or the preferred step width (0.13L). Humans appear to prefer a step width that minimizes metabolic cost.},

	abstract = {We examined healthy human subjects wearing robotic ankle exoskeletons to study the metabolic cost of ankle muscle-tendon work during uphill walking. The exoskeletons were powered by artificial pneumatic muscles and controlled by the user's soleus electromyography. We hypothesized that as the demand for net positive external mechanical work increased with surface gradient, the positive work delivered by ankle exoskeletons would produce greater reductions in users' metabolic cost. Nine human subjects walked at 1.25 m s(-1) on gradients of 0\%, 5\%, 10\% and 15\%. We compared rates of O(2) consumption and CO(2) production, exoskeleton mechanics, joint kinematics, and surface electromyography between unpowered and powered exoskeleton conditions. On steeper inclines, ankle exoskeletons delivered more average positive mechanical power (P{\textbackslash}textless0.0001; +0.37+/-0.03 W kg(-1) at 15\% grade and +0.23+/-0.02 W kg(-1) at 0\% grade) and reduced subjects' net metabolic power by more (P{\textbackslash}textless0.0001; -0.98+/-0.12 W kg(-1) at 15\% grade and -0.45+/-0.07 W kg(-1) at 0\% grade). Soleus muscle activity was reduced by 16-25\% when wearing powered exoskeletons on all surface gradients (P{\textbackslash}textless0.0008). The ;apparent efficiency' of ankle muscle-tendon mechanical work decreased from 0.53 on level ground to 0.38 on 15\% grade. This suggests a decreased contribution from previously stored Achilles' tendon elastic energy and an increased contribution from actively shortening ankle plantar flexor muscle fibers to ankle muscle-tendon positive work during walking on steep uphill inclines. Although exoskeletons delivered 61\% more mechanical work at the ankle up a 15\% grade compared with level walking, relative reductions in net metabolic power were similar across surface gradients (10-13\%). These results suggest a shift in the relative distribution of mechanical power output to more proximal (knee and hip) joints during inclined walking.},

We performed a functional magnetic resonance imaging study to determine whether and where activity in the human brain was available to guide effort-based cost–benefit valuation. Subjects were scanned while they performed a series of effortful actions to obtain secondary reinforcers. At the beginning of each trial, subjects were presented with one of eight different visual cues that they had learned indicated how much effort the course of action would entail and how much reward could be expected at its completion. Cue-locked activity in the ventral striatum and midbrain reflected the net value of the course of action, signaling the expected amount of reward discounted by the amount of effort to be invested. Activity in ACCd also reflected the interaction of both expected reward and effort costs. Posterior orbitofrontal and insular activity, however, only reflected the expected reward magnitude. The ventral striatum and anterior cingulate cortex may be the substrate of effort-based cost–benefit valuation in primates as well as in rats.},

These effort-cost calculations seem to be mediated by a distributed neural circuit including the anterior cingulate cortex and subcortical targets of dopamine neurons. On the basis of evidence of dysfunction in these systems in schizophrenia (SZ), we examined whether effort-cost computations were impaired in SZ patients and whether these deficits were associated with negative symptoms. Methods Effort-cost decision-making performance was evaluated in 44 patients with SZ and 36 demographically matched control subjects. Subjects performed a computerized task where they were presented with a series of 30 trials in which they could choose between making 20 button presses for \$1 or 100 button presses for higher amounts (varying from \$3 to \$7 across trials). Probability of reward receipt was also manipulated to determine whether certain (100\%) or uncertain (50\%) reward affected effort-based decision-making. Results Patients were less likely than control subjects to select the high-effort response alternative during the 100\% probability condition, particularly when the value payoff was highest (i.e., \$6 and \$7). Patients were also less likely to select the high-effort option on trials after reward in the 50\% probability condition. Furthermore, these impairments in effort-cost computations were greatest among patients with elevated negative symptoms. There was no association with haloperidol equivalent dosage. Conclusions The motivational impairments of SZ might be associated with abnormalities in estimating the “cost” of effortful behavior. This increased effort cost might undermine volition.},

	abstract = {An intriguing finding in motor control studies is the marked effect of risk on movement decision making. However, there are inconsistent reports of risk-sensitivity across different movements and tasks, with both risk-seeking and risk-averse behavior observed. This raises the question of whether risk-sensitivity in movement decision making is context dependent and specific to the movement or task being performed. We investigated whether risk-sensitivity transfers between dissimilar movements within a single task. Healthy young adults made arm-reaching movements or whole-body leaning movements to move a cursor as close to the edge of a virtual cliff as possible without moving beyond the edge. They received points on the basis of the cursor's final proximity to the cliff edge. Risk was manipulated by increasing the point penalty associated with the cliff region and/or adding Gaussian noise to the cursor. We compared subjects' movement endpoints with endpoints predicted by a subject-specific, risk-neutral model of movement planning. Subjects demonstrated risk-seeking behavior in both movements that was consistent across risk environments, moving closer to the cliff than the model predicted. However, subjects were significantly more risk-seeking in whole-body movements. Our results present the first evidence of risk-sensitivity in whole-body movements. They also demonstrate that the direction of risk-sensitivity (i.e., risk-seeking or risk-averse) is similar between arm-reaching and whole-body movements, although degree of risk-sensitivity did not transfer from one movement to another. This finding has important implications for the ability of quantitative descriptions of decision making to generalize across movements and, ultimately, decision-making contexts.},

	abstract = {Speed-accuracy trade-off is an intensively studied law governing almost all behavioral tasks across species. Here we show that motivation by reward breaks this law, by simultaneously invigorating movement and improving response precision. We devised a model to explain this paradoxical effect of reward by considering a new factor: the cost of control. Exerting control to improve response precision might itself come at a cost—a cost to attenuate a proportion of intrinsic neural noise. Applying a noise-reduction cost to optimal motor control predicted that reward can increase both velocity and accuracy. Similarly, application to decision-making predicted that reward reduces reaction times and errors in cognitive control. We used a novel saccadic distraction task to quantify the speed and accuracy of both movements and decisions under varying reward. Both faster speeds and smaller errors were observed with higher incentives, with the results best fitted by a model including a precision cost. Recent theories consider dopamine to be a key neuromodulator in mediating motivational effects of reward. We therefore examined how Parkinson’s disease (PD), a condition associated with dopamine depletion, alters the effects of reward. Individuals with PD showed reduced reward sensitivity in their speed and accuracy, consistent in our model with higher noise-control costs. Including a cost of control over noise explains how reward may allow apparent performance limits to be surpassed. On this view, the pattern of reduced reward sensitivity in PD patients can specifically be accounted for by a higher cost for controlling noise., • The speed-accuracy trade-off in motor and cognitive control can be broken by reward • Apparent limits of performance can be overcome by motivation • A cost for reducing intrinsic neural noise quantitatively explains such improvements • Reduced reward effects in Parkinson’s disease suggest an increased cost of control , Manohar et al. investigate how motivation by reward can improve both speed and accuracy, apparently exceeding the limits of the speed-accuracy trade-off. They propose a cost for reducing intrinsic neural noise. Optimizing this cost predicts both motor and cognitive performance. The cost of control may be increased in Parkinson’s disease.},

Even though this observation is ancient and confirmed by wide experience, none of the disciplines that deal with decision making has explained it. Dr. Ainslie uses findings from behavioral experiments to show that there is a basic tendency for both lower animals and human beings to form temporary preferences for the poorer but earlier of two goals, when the poorer goal is close at hand. People compensate for this tendency by strategically adjusting behavior in anticipation of their own future motivational states. Unlike theories that have accounted for irrationalities on the basis of the repression or conditioning of motives, this book proposes that temporary preferences for objectively inferior goals arise inevitably from the way both animals and human beings perceive delay. The implications of this change in viewpoint help provide a rationale for hitherto puzzling behavior, from Freud's defense mechanism to the force of willpower, as well as conspicuous failures of willpower in addictions and other psychiatric disorders. This approach also sheds light on subjects that have been controversial in moral philosophy: weakness of will, self-deception, freedom, and responsibility.

	abstract = {Rationale: Impulsivity is implicated in drug dependence. Recent studies show problems with alcohol and opioid dependence are associated with rapid discounting of the value of delayed outcomes. Furthermore, discounting may be particularly steep for the drug of dependence. Objectives: We determined if these findings could be extended to the behavior of cigarette smokers. In particular, we compared the discounting of hypothetical monetary outcomes by current, never, and ex-smokers of cigarettes. We also examined discounting of delayed hypothetical cigarettes by current smokers. Methods: Current cigarette smokers (n=23), never-smokers (n=22) and ex-smokers (n=21) indicated preference for immediate versus delayed money in a titration procedure that determined indifference points at various delays. The titration procedure was repeated with cigarettes for smokers. The degree to which the delayed outcomes were discounted was estimated with two non-linear decay models: an exponential model and a hyperbolic model. Results: Current smokers discounted the value of delayed money more than did the comparison groups. Never- and ex-smokers did not differ in their discounting of money. For current smokers, delayed cigarettes lost subjective value more rapidly than delayed money. The hyperbolic equation provided better fits to the data than did the exponential equation for 74 out of 89 comparisons. Conclusions: Cigarette smoking, like other forms of drug dependence, is characterized by rapid loss of subjective value for delayed outcomes, particularly for the drug of dependence. Never- and ex-smokers could discount similarly because cigarette smoking is associated with a reversible increase in discounting or due to selection bias.},

The delay that preceded the small reinforcer was constant throughout a condition. The delay that preceded the large reinforcer was increased or decreased a number of times each session in order to estimate an "indifference point," a delay at which the subject chose each alternative about equally often. The experiment was designed to determine whether variations in any of four features of this adjusting-delay procedure would systematically alter the estimated indifference points. The four features were the total trial duration, the number of center-key responses necessary to begin a trial, the number of choice trials that preceded each change in the adjusting delay, and step size–the size of each increment and decrement in the delay. Manipulation of the first three features had no systematic effects on the indifference points. As step size was increased from 0.5 s to 6 s, within-session variability of the adjusting delay steadily increased, and the 6-s step size produced larger indifference-point estimates for some subjects. The results suggest that, within certain limits, these procedural features can be altered without affecting the indifference-point estimates, but that the use of a large step size can distort the estimates. Some theoretical implications of the relative constancy of indifference points across these procedural variations are discussed.},

I compared the effects of external and cognitive distraction from reward objects on the length of time which Ss waited for a preferred delayed reward before forfeiting it for a less preferred immediate one. In accord with predictions from an extension of frustrative nonreward theory, Ss waited much longer for a preferred reward when they were distracted from the rewards. Exp. II demonstrated that only certain cognitive events (thinking "fun things") served as effective ideational distractors. Thinking "sad thoughts" produced short delay times, as did thinking about the rewards themselves. In Exp. III the delayed rewards were not physically available for direct attention during the delay period, and Ss' cognitive attention was manipulated by prior instructions. While Ss waited, cognitions about the rewards significantly reduced, rather than enhanced, the length of their delay of gratification. Overall, attentional and cognitive mechanisms which enhanced the salience of rewards shortened the length of voluntary delay, while distractions from the rewards, overtly or cognitively, facilitated delay. Results permit a reinterpretation of basic mechanisms in voluntary delay of gratification and self-control. (16 ref.) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Economic theory suggests that these convergence points represent the subjective values (SVs) of different reward types on a common scale for comparison. To examine these hypotheses and to map the neural circuits for reward valuation we had food and water-deprived subjects make risky choices for money, food, and water both in and out of a brain scanner. We found that risk preferences across reward types were highly correlated; the level of risk aversion an individual showed when choosing among monetary lotteries predicted their risk aversion toward food and water. We also found that partially distinct neural networks represent the SVs of monetary and food rewards and that these distinct networks showed specific convergence points. The hypothalamic region mainly represented the SV for food, and the posterior cingulate cortex mainly represented the SV for money. In both the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and striatum there was a common area representing the SV of both reward types, but only the vmPFC significantly represented the SVs of money and food on a common scale appropriate for choice in our data set. A correlation analysis demonstrated interactions across money and food valuation areas and the common areas in the vmPFC and striatum. This may suggest that partially distinct valuation networks for different reward types converge on a unified valuation network, which enables a direct comparison between different reward types and hence guides valuation and choice.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to evaluate a Hill-based mathematical model of muscle energetics and to disclose inconsistencies in existing experimental data. For this purpose, we simulated iso-velocity contractions of mouse fast twitch EDL and slow twitch SOL fibers, and we compared the outcome to experimental results. The experimental results were extracted from two studies published in the literature, which were based on the same methodology but yielded different outcomes (B96 and B93). In the model, energy cost was modeled as the sum of heat and work. Parameters used to model heat rate were entirely independent of the experimental data-sets. Parameters describing the mechanical behavior were derived from both experimental studies. The model was found to accurately predict the muscle energetics and mechanical efficiency of data-set B96. The model could not, however, replicate the energetics and efficiency of SOL and EDL that were found in data-set B93. The model overestimated the shortening heat rate of EDL but, surprisingly, also the mechanical work rate for both muscles. This was surprising since mechanical characteristics of the model were derived directly from the experimental data. It was demonstrated that the inconsistencies in data-set B93 must have been due to some unexplained confounding artifact. It was concluded that the presented model of muscle energetics is valid for iso-velocity contractions of mammalian muscle since it accurately predicts experimental results of an independent data-set (B96). In addition, the model appeared to be helpful in revealing inconsistencies in a second data-set (B93).},

	abstract = {Skip to Next Section The power output of a muscle and its efficiency vary widely under different activation conditions. This is partially due to the complex interaction between the contractile component of a muscle and the serial elasticity. We investigated the relationship between power output and efficiency of muscle by developing a model to predict the power output and efficiency of muscles under varying activation conditions during cyclical length changes. A comparison to experimental data from two different muscle types suggests that the model can effectively predict the time course of force and mechanical energetic output of muscle for a wide range of contraction conditions, particularly during activation of the muscle. With fixed activation properties, discrepancies in the work output between the model and the experimental results were greatest at the faster and slower cycle frequencies than that for which the model was optimised. Further optimisation of the activation properties across each individual cycle frequency examined demonstrated that a change in the relationship between the concentration of the activator (Ca2+) and the activation level could account for these discrepancies. The variation in activation properties with speed provides evidence for the phenomenon of shortening deactivation, whereby at higher speeds of contraction the muscle deactivates at a faster rate. The results of this study demonstrate that predictions about the mechanics and energetics of muscle are possible when sufficient information is known about the specific muscle.},

	abstract = {SummaryWalking at a constant speed on a steep incline, the ratio of the mechanical work performed, as calculated by the body lift, to the energy expended, as calculated by the oxygen consumption, generally referred to as “efficiency”, is independent of the incline, and it amounts to 0.25 walking uphill and to — 1.2 walking downhill. These values can be regarded as the “efficiency” values for positive (uphill) and negative (downhill) work. Walking on the level or on a mild incline, both positive and negative work are performed within the step cycle. When an equal amount of positive and negative work is performed (level walking or running) the energy level of the body at the end of the performance does not change, and the “efficiency” as calculated amounts to 0.207. This work may be consideredwasted: it reaches a maximal amount on the level of 0.044 kgm/m kg walking, and of 0.088 kgm/m kg running. For this reason a constant pull in the direction of the movement cannot replace completely the pull given by the muscles, as when other systems of progression such as cycling, skiing, skating etc. are adopted. By far the greatest amount of energy spent in walking or running at a constant speed is spent in positive work performance to counteract the deceleration (negative work) taking place at the end of each step. Very little energy is supplied for internal work, i.e. to meet the resistance to progression due to friction within the body or at the contact of the foot with the soil.},

However, data from dynamical simulations provide a cause-effect framework for analyzing these measurements; for example, Part I (Gait Posture, in press) of this two-part review described how force generation in a muscle affects the acceleration and energy flow among the segments. This Part II reviews the mechanical and coordination concepts arising from analyses of simulations of walking. Simple models have elucidated the basic multisegmented ballistic and passive mechanics of walking. Dynamical models driven by net joint moments have provided clues about coordination in healthy and pathological gait. Simulations driven by muscle excitations have highlighted the partial stability afforded by muscles with their viscoelastic-like properties and the predictability of walking performance when minimization of metabolic energy per unit distance is assumed. When combined with neural control models for exciting motoneuronal pools, simulations have shown how the integrative properties of the neuro-musculo-skeletal systems maintain a stable gait. Other analyses of walking simulations have revealed how individual muscles contribute to trunk support and progression. Finally, we discuss how biomechanical models and simulations may enhance our understanding of the mechanics and muscle function of walking in individuals with gait impairments.},

Simply stated, this model consists of a contractile element (CE) that is surrounded, both in series and in parallel, by “passive” connective tissue (Figure 5.1). CE is furthermore characterized by two fundamental relationships: CE tension-length and CE force-velocity. Each of these is modulated by an activation input that is structurally distinct from the location for mechanical coupling between the muscle and the environment (Figure 5.1).},

Rats were trained on a cost–benefit T-maze task in which they could either choose to climb a barrier to obtain a high reward in one arm (HR arm) or could obtain a small reward in the other with no barrier present (LR arm). Before surgery, all animals were selecting the HR arm on almost every trial. However, after excitotoxic lesions to MFC, the rats shifted to selecting the LR arm on almost every trial. This was not caused by a spatial memory or motor deficit because the same rats returned to selecting the HR arm when the amount of effort needed to be expended to obtain reward in either arm was equalized by putting an identical barrier in the LR arm. Additional experiments demonstrated that the change in effort-based decisions observed in the rats was not caused by a complete insensitivity to reward and effort because they returned to choosing the HR arm if either the cost was reduced (by making the barrier smaller) or the benefit was increased (increasing the food ratio differential). Instead, the MFC lesion shifted the animals' decision criterion, making them more likely to choose the LR arm than the sham-lesioned animals. These results imply that medial frontal cortex is important for allowing the animal to put in more work to obtain greater rewards.},

	abstract = {Background Of the putative psychopathological endophenotypes in major depressive disorder (MDD), the anhedonic subtype is particularly well supported. Anhedonia is generally assumed to reflect aberrant motivation and reward responsivity. However, research has been limited by a lack of objective measures of reward motivation. We present the Effort-Expenditure for Rewards Task (EEfRT or “effort”), a novel behavioral paradigm as a means of exploring effort-based decision-making in humans. Using the EEfRT, we test the hypothesis that effort-based decision-making is related to trait anhedonia. Methods/Results 61 undergraduate students participated in the experiment. Subjects completed self-report measures of mood and trait anhedonia, and completed the EEfRT. Across multiple analyses, we found a significant inverse relationship between anhedonia and willingness to expend effort for rewards. Conclusions These findings suggest that anhedonia is specifically associated with decreased motivation for rewards, and provide initial validation for the EEfRT as a laboratory-based behavioral measure of reward motivation and effort-based decision-making in humans.},

	abstract = {A sagittal-plane model of the lower limb, which considered the possibility of antagonistic and synergistic muscle action and took account of the load-bearing roles of the cruciate ligaments, was applied to a dynamic analysis of level walking. It was hypothesized that: (1) the simple, one-sided constraints that intraarticular contact forces must be compressive and muscle and ligament forces tensile substantially reduce the redundancy of the load-transmitting structures of the lower limb, (2) many previously proposed optimization laws for muscle selection yield equivalent results, when they are applied to a finite set of admissible limiting solutions, and (3) the aforementioned optimization laws, when applied to a finite set of admissible limiting solutions, do not adequately predict the co-contraction of antagonistic muscles during gait. The problem of indeterminacy was resolved by considering all possible limiting solutions of the system unknowns on the dynamic equations. Although 498 limiting solutions of nine unknowns could arise at each sampled point on the gait cycle, the aforementioned one-sided constraints ruled out the large majority of them. It was shown that of the 498 possible, the minimum number of simultaneous admissible solutions for any subject was as few as three and the maximum number was only 18. The Principles of minimal total muscle force, squared muscle force, muscle stress, intra-articular contact force and instantaneous muscle power predicted remarkably similar patterns of muscle activity over the gait cycle. Of the six tested performance criteria, the Principle of minimal total ligament force was the least successful in terms of selecting solutions that closely matched the EMG patterns. This result implied that the muscles do not always act to protect the knee ligaments during gait. Finally, each of the above minimum principles failed to predict any antagonistic quadriceps-hamstrings action at the knee and hip around the event of heelstrike, although such activity was indicated by electromyography.},

The book is divided into 12 chapters, the first being a formulation of the economic problem, presenting the objectives of the system used, the notion of utility, and a description of the structure of the authors' theory. The second chapter is a general formal description of games of strategy, and chapters 3-8 treat particular classifications of games. In chapter 9, the authors discuss the composition and decomposition of games. Chapter 10 is on simple games, and chapter 11 on general non-zero-sum games. (These are games in which the sum of all payments received by all players is not zero. Thus such games involve production or destruction of goods and are more closely analogous to general social and economic situations than zero-sum games.)

	abstract = {Skip to Next Section The ‘cost of generating force’ hypothesis proposes that the metabolic rate during running is determined by the rate of muscle force development (1/tc, where tc=contact time) and the volume of active leg muscle. A previous study assumed a constant recruited muscle volume and reported that the rate of force development alone explained ∼70\% of the increase in metabolic rate for human runners across a moderate velocity range (2–4 m s−1). We hypothesized that over a wider range of velocities, the effective mechanical advantage (EMA) of the lower limb joints would overall decrease, necessitating a greater volume of active muscle recruitment. Ten high-caliber male human runners ran on a force-measuring treadmill at 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 and 18 km h−1 while we analyzed their expired air to determine metabolic rates. We measured ground reaction forces and joint kinematics to calculate contact time and estimate active muscle volume. From 8 to 18 km h−1, metabolic rate increased 131\% from 9.28 to 21.44 W kg−1. tc decreased from 0.280 s to 0.190 s, and thus the rate of force development (1/tc) increased by 48\%. Ankle EMA decreased by 19.7±11\%, knee EMA increased by 11.1±26.9\% and hip EMA decreased by 60.8±11.8\%. Estimated active muscle volume per leg increased 52.8\% from 1663±152 cm3 to 2550±169 cm3. Overall, 98\% of the increase in metabolic rate across the velocity range was explained by just two factors: the rate of generating force and the volume of active leg muscle.},

	abstract = {Muscular forces generated during locomotion depend on an animal's speed, gait, and size and underlie the energy demand to power locomotion. Changes in limb posture affect muscle forces by altering the mechanical advantage of the ground reaction force (R) and therefore the effective mechanical advantage (EMA = r/R, where r is the muscle mechanical advantage) for muscle force production. We used inverse dynamics based on force plate and kinematic recordings of humans as they walked and ran at steady speeds to examine how changes in muscle EMA affect muscle force-generating requirements at these gaits. We found a 68\% decrease in knee extensor EMA when humans changed gait from a walk to a run compared with an 18\% increase in hip extensor EMA and a 23\% increase in ankle extensor EMA. Whereas the knee joint was extended (154–176°) during much of the support phase of walking, its flexed position (134–164°) during running resulted in a 5.2-fold increase in quadriceps impulse (time-integrated force during stance) needed to support body weight on the ground. This increase was associated with a 4.9-fold increase in the ground reaction force moment about the knee. In contrast, extensor impulse decreased 37\% (P {\textbackslash}textless 0.05) at the hip and did not change at the ankle when subjects switched from a walk to a run. We conclude that the decrease in limb mechanical advantage (mean limb extensor EMA) and increase in knee extensor impulse during running likely contribute to the higher metabolic cost of transport in running than in walking. The low mechanical advantage in running humans may also explain previous observations of a greater metabolic cost of transport for running humans compared with trotting and galloping quadrupeds of similar size.},

	abstract = {It is known that hand transport and grasping are functionally different but spatially coordinated components of reach-to-grasp (RTG) movements. As an extension of this notion, we suggested that body segments involved in RTG movements are controlled as a coherent ensemble by a global minimization process associated with the necessity for the hand to reach the motor goal. Different RTG components emerge following this process without pre-programming. Specifically, the minimization process may result from the tendency of neuromuscular elements to diminish the spatial gap between the actual arm-hand configuration and its virtual (referent) configuration specified by the brain. The referent configuration is specified depending on the object shape, localization, and orientation. Since the minimization process is gradual, it can be interrupted and resumed following mechanical perturbations, at any phase during RTG movements, including hand closure. To test this prediction of the minimization hypothesis, we asked subjects to reach and grasp a cube placed within the reach of the arm. Vision was prevented during movement until the hand returned to its initial position. As predicted, by arresting wrist motion at different points of hand transport in randomly selected trials, it was possible to halt changes in hand aperture at any phase, not only during hand opening but also during hand closure. Aperture changes resumed soon after the wrist was released. Another test of the minimization hypothesis was made in RTG movements to an object placed beyond the reach of the arm. It has previously been shown (Rossi et al. in J Physiol 538:659–671, 2002) that in such movements, the trunk motion begins to contribute to hand transport only after a critical phase when the shifts in the referent arm configuration have finished (at about the time when hand velocity is maximal). The minimization rule suggests that when the virtual contribution of the arm to hand transport is completed, guidance of hand aperture switches from the arm to the trunk control system. As a consequence, hand aperture changes can be halted by trunk arrests but only if they are prolonged beyond a critical phase. As predicted, hand transport and hand aperture in RTG movements beyond the reach of the arm were halted by trunk arrests only if they were prolonged beyond the time of peak hand velocity. Hand motion and aperture changes resumed only when the trunk was released. While supporting the minimization hypothesis, our findings imply that not only spatial but also temporal characteristics of each component, including the shortest, hand closure component of RTG movements, are controlled in a flexible, task-specific way.},

	abstract = {Robots will become ubiquitously useful only when they can use few attempts to teach themselves to perform different tasks, even with complex bodies and in dynamical environments. Vertebrates, in fact, successfully use trial-and-error to learn multiple tasks in spite of their intricate tendon-driven anatomies. Roboticists find such tendon-driven systems particularly hard to control because they are simultaneously nonlinear, under-determined (many tendon tensions combine to produce few net joint torques), and over-determined (few joint rotations define how many tendons need to be reeled-in/payed-out). We demonstrate—for the first time in simulation and in hardware—how a model-free approach allows few-shot autonomous learning to produce effective locomotion in a 3-tendon/2-joint tendon-driven leg. Initially, an artificial neural network fed by sparsely sampled data collected using motor babbling creates an inverse map from limb kinematics to motor activations, which is analogous to juvenile vertebrates playing during development. Thereafter, iterative reward-driven exploration of candidate motor activations simultaneously refines the inverse map and finds a functional locomotor limit-cycle autonomously. This biologically-inspired algorithm, which we call G2P (General to Particular), enables versatile adaptation of robots to changes in the target task, mechanics of their bodies, and environment. Moreover, this work empowers future studies of few-shot autonomous learning in biological systems, which is the foundation of their enviable functional versatility.},

The isometric contractile properties and morphological characteristics of the muscle unit portion of motor units were investigated in the medial gastrocnemius (MG) muscle of Fischer 344 rats. Individual motor units were functionally isolated by stimulating single MG axons in finely dissected ventral root filaments. 2. To study the mechanical properties of the motor units in the rat MG muscle, ninety-six motor units in five animals were classified into three categories (type FF, FR and S units) using two physiological criteria: presence or absence of the 'sag' property and fatigability. The relative distribution of the different motor unit types in the sample was 35.4\% for type FF, 47.9\% for type FR, and 16.7\% for type S units. 3. There was little overlap in the distribution of twitch contraction time between type F (including types FF and FR) and type S units. The mean value was 17.1 ms for type FF, 15.7 ms for type FR, and 28.0 ms for type S units. Type FF units produced the largest tetanic tension (mean +/- S.D.; 201 +/- 75 mN). Tension output of type S units was the smallest (15 +/- 6 mN), and that of type FR units was intermediate (100 +/- 45 mN). These values were significantly different. 4. A muscle unit portion of twenty-three motor units (8 FF, 6 FR, and 9 S units) was depleted of its glycogen through repetitive stimulation after characterization of its mechanical properties. Cross-sectional areas of units fibres and innervation ratio were directly measured in sections stained for glycogen using a periodic and acid-Schiff (PAS) reaction. Specific tension of unit fibres was calculated by dividing the maximum tetanic tension of a unit by its total fibre area. 5. The number of unit fibres ranged from 44 to 77 for type S, 116 to 198 for type FR, and 221 to 356 for type FF units, and differences among their means (66, 154 and 271, respectively) were significant. Tetanic tension was correlated with innervation ratio for all of the twenty-three units, or units within a particular type. 6. Mean fibre area for type S units (1983 microns2) was significantly smaller than that for type FF units (3489 microns2). Fibres belonging to type FR units had an intermediate size (2648 microns2). Correlation between tetanic tension and fibre area was significant for either all units or units within a particular type. 7. Total cross-sectional area was significantly different among the motor unit types, and was highly correlated to the maximum tetanic tension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	abstract = {1. The electrical activity of single motor units has been recorded from the first dorsal interosseus muscle of normal human subjects during voluntary, isometric contractions, together with the force generated by the muscle., 2. By averaging the force correlated with the impulses from a single motor unit, the contraction time and twitch tension generated by that motor unit could be measured. When the rate of discharge was limited, either voluntarily or by automatic selection of intervals for analysis, the time for the tension to decline to half its maximum value (half-relaxation time) could also be measured for some motor units., 3. Under our experimental conditions the trains of impulses from different motor units in most subjects were generated quite independently as tested by (a) measuring the correlation between activity in single units and that in the whole muscle as recorded by the surface electromyogram (e.m.g.), (b) measuring the cross-correlations between pairs of single units and (c) comparing the tension generated by stimulating single motor units with the average tension correlated in time with voluntary activity of single units in the same location., 4. In one normal subject evidence of synchronization between separate motor units was obtained. Cross-correlation studies suggested that the cause of the synchronization was the presence of substantial common excitation received by the various motor units in the muscle., 5. The frequency response for the contractions of single motor units was well fitted by that for a linear, second-order system with nearly critical damping. However, when stimulation of a few motor units was superimposed on a voluntary contraction, underdamped (oscillatory) responses were seen which were probably of reflex origin., 6. The significance of these results in relation to the normal postural tremor in hand muscles is discussed.},

	abstract = {Reliable transmission of activity from nerve to muscle is necessary for the normal function of the body. The term ‘safety factor’ refers to the ability of neuromuscular transmission to remain effective under various physiological conditions and stresses. This is a result of the amount of transmitter released per nerve impulse being greater than that required to trigger an action potential in the muscle fibre. The safety factor is a measure of this excess of released transmitter. In this review we discuss the practical difficulties involved in estimating the safety factor in vitro. We then consider the factors that influence the safety factor in vivo. While presynaptic transmitter release may be modulated on a moment to moment basis, the postsynaptic features that determine the effect of released transmitter are not so readily altered to meet changing demands. Different strategies are used by different species to ensure reliable neuromuscular transmission. Some, like frogs, rely on releasing a large amount of transmitter while others, like man, rely on elaborate postsynaptic specialisations to enhance the response to transmitter. In normal adult mammals, the safety factor is generally 3–5. Both pre- and postsynaptic components change during development and may show plasticity in response to injury or disease. Thus, both acquired autoimmune and inherited congenital diseases of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) can significantly reduce, or even transiently increase, safety factor.},

	abstract = {1. The twitch properties of human thenar motor units were examined in response to intraneural motor-axon stimulation. Force components of thumb abduction and flexion were measured before and after tetanic stimulation. The magnitude, direction, and time derivatives of resultant forces, together with axon conduction velocities, were calculated for each unit. 2. Various indexes of contraction and relaxation rate were measured including contraction time (time from force onset to peak), one-half relaxation time (time from peak force to one-half that value), normalized maximum contraction and normalized maximum relaxation rates (peak positive and negative time derivatives of the force signal normalized to twitch force), and the times at which these maximum rates occurred. 3. For different units, the directions of resultant forces were approximately evenly distributed between thumb abduction and flexion. At the onset of the experiment, initial twitch forces ranged from 3 to 34 mN, contraction times from 35 to 80 ms, and one-half relaxation times from 25 to 108 ms. 4. Resultant twitch forces were positively correlated to normalized maximum relaxation rates, but not to other rate indexes or to conduction velocity. The various contraction rate measures were correlated to each other, but generally not to relaxation rates. 5. After the first test involving tetanic stimulation, the twitches of most units were potentiated and slowed, especially their relaxation phase. However, the extent of these changes varied considerably between units. In general, units with weak initial forces potentiated most, some up to three-fold. These changes in twitch properties were denoted posttetanic twitch potentiation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

This relationship has far-reaching consequences for the control of muscular tension, and also accounts for significant differences in the properties of muscle fibres and motor units. The probable basis for the relationship is that the amplitude of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (e.p.s.ps) is also correlated inversely with cell size, but no satisfactory explanation for this finding is known. We now describe experiments which indicate that afferent impulses invade the relatively simple ramifications of fibres going to small motoneurones more completely than the extensive arborisations going to large cells. This results in activation of a higher percentage of the synaptic endings on small cells, which produces larger e.p.s.ps in them and accounts for their greater susceptibility to discharge.},

Thus by changing gait, human beings keep the energy cost of locomotion to a minimum as their speed increases. One reason this relation holds is that in humans, metabolic rate increases curvilinearly with walking speed1. If metabolism were a curvilinear function of speed within each of the gaits used by quadrupeds, it would support the hypothesis that they also change gait to minimize energetic cost. There is an old controversy about whether metabolic rate increases linearly or curvilinearly in running humans1,2 but all previous reports have suggested that metabolic rate increases linearly with speed in quadrupeds. Extended gaits were an important experimental tool in the study of human gait changes; thus we have trained three small horses (110–170 kg) to walk, trot and gallop on a motorized treadmill, and to extend their gaits on command. We report here that, using measurements of rates of oxygen consumption as an indicator of rates of energy consumption, we have confirmed that the natural gait at any speed indeed entails the smallest possible energy expenditure.},

	abstract = {There has been considerable interest from the fields of biology, economics, psychology, and ecology about how decision costs decrease the value of rewarding outcomes. For example, formal descriptions of how reward value changes with increasing temporal delays allow for quantifying individual decision preferences, as in animal species populating different habitats, or normal and clinical human populations. Strikingly, it remains largely unclear how humans evaluate rewards when these are tied to energetic costs, despite the surge of interest in the neural basis of effort-guided decision-making and the prevalence of disorders showing a diminished willingness to exert effort (e.g., depression). One common assumption is that effort discounts reward in a similar way to delay. Here we challenge this assumption by formally comparing competing hypotheses about effort and delay discounting. We used a design specifically optimized to compare discounting behavior for both effort and delay over a wide range of decision costs (Experiment 1). We then additionally characterized the profile of effort discounting free of model assumptions (Experiment 2). Contrary to previous reports, in both experiments effort costs devalued reward in a manner opposite to delay, with small devaluations for lower efforts, and progressively larger devaluations for higher effort-levels (concave shape). Bayesian model comparison confirmed that delay-choices were best predicted by a hyperbolic model, with the largest reward devaluations occurring at shorter delays. In contrast, an altogether different relationship was observed for effort-choices, which were best described by a model of inverse sigmoidal shape that is initially concave. Our results provide a novel characterization of human effort discounting behavior and its first dissociation from delay discounting. This enables accurate modelling of cost-benefit decisions, a prerequisite for the investigation of the neural underpinnings of effort-guided choice and for understanding the deficits in clinical disorders characterized by behavioral inactivity.},

While our knowledge about discount functions for time and probability costs is quite advanced, little is known about how physical effort discounts reward. In the present study we compared three different models in a binary choice task in which human participants had to squeeze a handgrip to earn monetary rewards: a linear, a hyperbolic, and a parabolic model. On the group as well as the individual level, the concave parabolic model explained most variance of the choice data, thus contrasting with the typical hyperbolic discounting of reward value by delay.

For example, while several models have described reach planning as primarily kinematic, some studies have suggested that implicit knowledge about biomechanics may also exert some influence on the planning of reaching movements. Here, we investigated whether decisions about reaching movements are influenced by biomechanical factors and whether these factors are taken into account before movement onset. To this end, we designed an experimental paradigm in which humans made free choices between two potential reaching movements where the options varied in path distance as well as biomechanical factors related to movement energy and stability. Our results suggest that the biomechanical properties of potential actions strongly influence the selection between them. In particular, in our task, subjects preferred movements whose final trajectory was better aligned with the major axis of the arm's mobility ellipse, even when the launching properties were very similar. This reveals that the nervous system can predict biomechanical properties of potential actions before movement onset and that these predictions, in addition to purely abstract criteria, may influence the decision-making process.},

Here we hypothesize that the brain decides the vigor of a movement (duration and velocity) based on the expected discounted reward associated with that movement. We begin by showing that durations of saccades of varying amplitude can be accurately predicted by a model in which motor commands maximize expected discounted reward. This result suggests that reward is temporally discounted even in timescales of tens of milliseconds. One interpretation of temporal discounting is that the true objective of the brain is to maximize the rate of reward—which is equivalent to a specific form of hyperbolic discounting. A consequence of this idea is that the vigor of saccades should change as one alters the intertrial intervals between movements. We find experimentally that in healthy humans, as intertrial intervals are varied, saccade peak velocities and durations change on a trial-by-trial basis precisely as predicted by a model in which the objective is to maximize the rate of reward. Our results are inconsistent with theories in which reward is discounted exponentially. We suggest that there exists a single cost, rate of reward, which provides a unifying principle that may govern control of movements in timescales of milliseconds, as well as decision making in timescales of seconds to years.},

In the present article, we present the first direct evidence for a neural analogue of effort discounting. We used fMRI to measure neural responses to monetary rewards in the human nucleus accumbens (NAcc), a structure previously demonstrated to encode reference-dependent reward information. The magnitude of accumbens activation was found to vary with both reward outcome and the degree of mental effort demanded to obtain individual rewards. For a fixed level of reward, the NAcc was less strongly activated following a high-demand for effort than following a low demand. The magnitude of this effect was noted to correlate with preceding activation in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, a region that has been proposed to monitor information-processing demands and to mediate in the subjective experience of effort.},

Recently, neuroscientists have been turning to ecological approaches to address this issue, examining how animals evaluate the costs and benefits of different options. We present here evidence from rodents and monkeys that demonstrate the degree to which they take into account work and energetic requirements when deciding what responses to make. These calculations appear to be critically mediated by the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and mesolimbic dopamine (DA) pathways, with damage to either causing a bias towards options that are easily obtained but yield relatively smaller reward rather than alternatives that require more work but result in greater reward. The evaluation of such decisions appears to be carried out in systems independent of those involved in delay-discounting. We suggest that top-down signals from ACC to nucleus accumbens (NAc) and/or midbrain DA cells may be vital for overcoming effort-related response costs.},

	abstract = {Because negative symptoms, including motivational deficits, are a critical unmet need in schizophrenia, there are many ongoing efforts to develop new pharmacological and psychosocial interventions for these impairments. A common challenge of these studies involves how to evaluate and select optimal endpoints. Currently, all studies of negative symptoms in schizophrenia depend on ratings from clinician-conducted interviews. Effort-based decision-making tasks may provide a more objective, and perhaps more sensitive, endpoint for trials of motivational negative symptoms. These tasks assess how much effort a person is willing to exert for a given level of reward. This area has been well-studied with animal models of effort and motivation, and effort-based decision-making tasks have been adapted for use in humans. Very recently, several studies have examined physical and cognitive types of effort-based decision-making tasks in cross-sectional studies of schizophrenia, providing evidence for effort-related impairment in this illness. This article covers the theoretical background on effort-based decision-making tasks to provide a context for the subsequent articles in this theme section. In addition, we review the existing literature of studies using these tasks in schizophrenia, consider some practical challenges in adapting them for use in clinical trials in schizophrenia, and discuss interpretive challenges that are central to these types of tasks.},

Discussions of impulsiveness in the literature of economics, sociology, social psychology, dynamic psychology and psychiatry, behavioral psychology, and "behavior therapy" are reviewed. Impulsiveness seems to be best accounted for by the hyperbolic curves that have been found to describe the decline in effectiveness of rewards as the rewards are delayed from the time of choice. Such curves predict a reliable change of choice between some alternative rewards as a function of time. This change of choice provides a rationale for the known kinds of impulse control and relates them to several hitherto perplexing phenomena: behavioral rigidity, time-out from positive reinforcement, willpower, self-reward, compulsive traits, projection, boredom, and the capacity of punishing stimuli to attract attention.

Possible explanations for this behavior include minimizing musculoskeletal stresses and maximizing metabolic economy. If metabolic economy (cost of transport, CT) and preferred speeds are linked, then shifts in CT should produce shifts in preferred speed. To test this hypothesis, preferred speed was measured in trotting horses (n = 7) unloaded on the level and loaded with 19\% of their body weight on the level. The preferred speed on the level was 3.33 ± 0.09 (SE) m/s, and this decreased to 3.13 ± 0.11 m/s when loaded. In both conditions (no load and load), the rate of O2 consumption (n = 3) was a curvilinear function of speed that produced a minimum CT (i.e., speed at which trotting is most economical). When unloaded, the speed at which CT was minimum was very near the preferred speed. With a load, CT decreased and the minimum was also near the preferred speed of horses while carrying a load.},

The acceleration or deceleration of the subject, detected by the sensor and processed by the computer, is used to accelerate or decelerate the treadmill in real time. The system has been used to assess, in eight subjects, the self-selected speed of walking and running, the maximum “reasonable” speed of walking, and the minimum reasonable speed of running at different gradients (from level up to +25\%). This evidenced the speed range at which humans neither walk nor run, from 7.2 ± 0.6 to 8.4 ± 1.1 km/h for level locomotion, slightly narrowing at steeper slopes. These data confirm previous results, obtained indirectly from stride frequency recordings. The self-selected speed of walking decreases with increasing gradient (from 5.0 ± 0.8 km/h at 0\% to 3.0 ± 0.9 km/h at +25\%) and seems to be ∼30\% higher than the speed that minimizes the metabolic energy cost of walking, obtained from the literature, at all the investigated gradients. The advantages, limitations, and potential applications of the newly proposed methodology in physiology, biomechanics, and pathology of locomotion are discussed in this paper.},

The ability to achieve robust biological inference requires that practitioners know how and when to apply these tools. Here, we provide a general overview of current methods for the application of LMMs to biological data, and highlight the typical pitfalls that can be encountered in the statistical modelling process. We tackle several issues regarding methods of model selection, with particular reference to the use of information theory and multi-model inference in ecology. We offer practical solutions and direct the reader to key references that provide further technical detail for those seeking a deeper understanding. This overview should serve as a widely accessible code of best practice for applying LMMs to complex biological problems and model structures, and in doing so improve the robustness of conclusions drawn from studies investigating ecological and evolutionary questions.},

Five upper extremity specimens were obtained from four fresh cadavers. Anthropometric measures were obtained for each cadaver. Segment inertial parameters were estimated for each specimen from anthropometric measures of the cadaver from which the specimen was obtained. The three-dimensional kinematics of the humerus, ulna, and radius in different movements of the glenohumeral, humeroulnar and ulnoradial joints were measured for each specimen using of the 3Space™ tracking system (Isotrack, Polhemus). The instantaneous rotation center of the glenohumeral joint and the instantaneous rotation axes of elbow flexion and forearm pronation were determined for each specimen from the kinematic data. The specimens were dissected and the muscle origins and insertions and bony structures needed in upper extremity modeling were digitized using the 3Space™ system. The shapes of muscle origins and insertions were estimated. Muscle length, volume and pennation angle were measured for the estimation of physiological cross-sectional areas of each muscle. The results, which are given for one specimen, showed that the rotation center of the glenohumeral joint was very close to the geometric center of the joint with a mean distance of 4 mm. The mean angle between the flexion-extension and pro-supination axes of the elbow joint was 94°. The minimum distance between these two axes was about 4 mm.},

The aim of such models is to estimate or predict muscle forces, joint moments, and/or joint kinematics from neural signals. This is a four-step process. In the first step, muscle activation dynamics govern the transformation from the neural signal to a measure of muscle activation—a time varying parameter between 0 and 1. In the second step, muscle contraction dynamics characterize how muscle activations are transformed into muscle forces. The third step requires a model of the musculoskeletal geometry to transform muscle forces to joint moments. Finally, the equations of motion allow joint moments to be transformed into joint movements. Each step involves complex nonlinear relationships. The focus of this paper is on the details involved in the first two steps, since these are the most challenging to the biomechanician. The global process is then explained through applications to the study of predicting isometric elbow moments and dynamic knee kinetics.},

	abstract = {How humans achieve long-term goals in an uncertain environment, via repeated trials and noisy observations, is an important problem in cognitive science. We investigate this behavior in the context of a multi-armed bandit task. We compare human behavior to a variety of models that vary in their representational and computational complexity. Our result shows that subjects’ choices, on a trial-totrial basis, are best captured by a “forgetful” Bayesian iterative learning model [21] in combination with a partially myopic decision policy known as Knowledge Gradient [7]. This model accounts for subjects’ trial-by-trial choice better than a number of other previously proposed models, including optimal Bayesian learning and risk minimization, e-greedy and win-stay-lose-shift. It has the added beneﬁt of being closest in performance to the optimal Bayesian model than all the other heuristic models that have the same computational complexity (all are signiﬁcantly less complex than the optimal model). These results constitute an advancement in the theoretical understanding of how humans negotiate the tension between exploration and exploitation in a noisy, imperfectly known environment.},

	abstract = {Optimists hold positive a priori beliefs about the future. In Bayesian statistical theory, a priori beliefs can be overcome by experience. However, optimistic beliefs can at times appear surprisingly resistant to evidence, suggesting that optimism might also influence how new information is selected and learned. Here, we use a novel Pavlovian conditioning task, embedded in a normative framework, to directly assess how trait optimism, as classically measured using self-report questionnaires, influences choices between visual targets, by learning about their association with reward progresses. We find that trait optimism relates to an a priori belief about the likelihood of rewards, but not losses, in our task. Critically, this positive belief behaves like a probabilistic prior, i.e. its influence reduces with increasing experience. Contrary to findings in the literature related to unrealistic optimism and self-beliefs, it does not appear to influence the iterative learning process directly., The optimism bias is regarded as one of the most prevalent and robust cognitive biases documented in psychology and behavioral economics. In individuals, trait optimism is usually measured using self-report questionnaires. However, choices in simple behavioral tasks can also be used to infer how optimistic people are in practice. We asked human subjects to fill in questionnaires about trait optimism, then to participate in a behavioral experiment where they needed to infer the likelihood of visual targets to be associated with a reward. Using modeling, we could then quantify the link between self-report trait optimism and decision or learning biases. We find that people who report that they are optimistic have a positive a priori bias on the likelihood of future reward, whose influence reduces with experience. In our task, trait optimism doesn't distort how new information is integrated: subjects update their estimates similarly following information that is better or worse than expected.},

The control strategy during targeted movements may also take into account the rewards or costs of any outcomes that may occur. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that movement time in Fitts’ Law emerges not only from the accuracy constraints of the task, but also depends on the perceived cost of error for missing the targets. Subjects were asked to touch targets on an iPad® screen with different costs for missed targets. We manipulated the probability of error by comparing children with dystonia (who are characterized by increased intrinsic motor variability) to typically developing children. The results show a strong effect of the cost of error on the Fitts’ Law relationship characterized by an increase in movement time as cost increased. In addition, we observed a greater sensitivity to increased cost for children with dystonia, and this behavior appears to minimize the average cost. The findings support a proposed mathematical model that explains how movement time in a Fitts-like task is related to perceived risk.},

The goal of this study was to determine whether the advanced preparation of simple actions reflected the expected value of the potential outcomes. Human subjects were required to direct a saccadic eye movement to a visual target that was presented either to the left or right of a central fixation point on each trial. Expected value was manipulated by adjusting the probability of presenting each target and their associated magnitude of monetary reward across 15 blocks of trials. We found that saccadic reaction times (SRTs) were negatively correlated to the relative expected value of the targets. Occasionally, an irrelevant visual distractor was presented before the target to probe the spatial allocation of saccadic preparation. Distractor-directed errors (oculomotor captures) varied as a function of the relative expected value of, and the distance of distractors from, the potential valued targets. SRTs and oculomotor captures were better correlated to the relative expected value of actions than to reward probability, reward magnitude, or overall motivation. Together, our results suggest that the level and spatial distribution of competitive dynamic neural fields representing saccadic preparation reflect the relative expected value of the potential actions.},

Yet, the principles underlying the formation of human movement vigour remain unclear, particularly in view of intriguing inter-individual variability. It has been hypothesized that how the brain values time may be the cornerstone of such differences, beyond biomechanics. Here, we focused on the vigour of self-paced reaching movement and assessed the stability of vigour via repeated measurements within participants. We used an optimal control methodology to identify a cost of time (CoT) function underlying each participant’s vigour, considering a model of the biomechanical cost of movement. We then tested the extent to which anthropometric or psychological traits, namely boredom proneness and impulsivity, could account for a significant part of inter-individual variance in vigour and CoT parameters. Our findings show that the vigour of reaching is largely idiosyncratic and tend to corroborate a relation between the relative steepness of the identified CoT and boredom proneness, a psychological trait relevant to one’s relationship with time in decision-making.},

	abstract = {An electromyographic (EMG) activity pattern for individual muscles in the gait cycle exhibits a great deal of intersubject, intermuscle and context-dependent variability. Here we examined the issue of common underlying patterns by applying factor analysis to the set of EMG records obtained at different walking speeds and gravitational loads. To this end healthy subjects were asked to walk on a treadmill at speeds of 1, 2, 3 and 5kmh−1 as well as when 35–95\% of the body weight was supported using a harness. We recorded from 12–16 ipsilateral leg and trunk muscles using both surface and intramuscular recording and determined the average, normalized EMG of each record for 10–15 consecutive step cycles. We identified five basic underlying factors or component waveforms that can account for about 90\% of the total waveform variance across different muscles during normal gait. Furthermore, while activation patterns of individual muscles could vary dramatically with speed and gravitational load, both the limb kinematics and the basic EMG components displayed only limited changes. Thus, we found a systematic phase shift of all five factors with speed in the same direction as the shift in the onset of the swing phase. This tendency for the factors to be timed according to the lift-off event supports the idea that the origin of the gait cycle generation is the propulsion rather than heel strike event. The basic invariance of the factors with walking speed and with body weight unloading implies that a few oscillating circuits drive the active muscles to produce the locomotion kinematics. A flexible and dynamic distribution of these basic components to the muscles may result from various descending and proprioceptive signals that depend on the kinematic and kinetic demands of the movements.},

In the single stance phase of walking, center of mass motion resembles that of an inverted pendulum. Theoretically, mechanical work is not necessary for producing the pendular motion, but work is needed to redirect the center of mass velocity from one pendular arc to the next during the transition between steps. A collision model predicts a rate of negative work proportional to the fourth power of step length. Positive work is required to restore the energy lost, potentially exacting a proportional metabolic cost. We tested these predictions with humans (N=9) walking over a range of step lengths (0.4-1.1 m) while keeping step frequency fixed at 1.8 Hz. We measured individual limb external mechanical work using force plates, and metabolic rate using indirect calorimetry. As predicted, average negative and positive external mechanical work rates increased with the fourth power of step length (from 1 W to 38 W; r2=0.96). Metabolic rate also increased with the fourth power of step length (from 7 W to 379 W; r2=0.95), and linearly with mechanical work rate. Mechanical work for step-to-step transitions, rather than pendular motion itself, appears to be a major determinant of the metabolic cost of walking.},

Several cost functions are proposed in the literature that are very different in nature (e.g., control effort, torque change, and jerk), yet each can predict common movement characteristics. We set out to disentangle predictions of the different variables using a combination of modeling and empirical studies. Subjects performed goal-directed arm movements in a force field (FF) in combination with visual perturbations of seen hand position. This FF was designed to have distinct optimal movements for muscle-input and dynamic costs while leaving kinematic cost unchanged. Visual perturbations in turn changed the kinematic cost but left the dynamic and muscle-input costs unchanged. An optimally controlled, physiologically realistic arm model was used to predict movements under the various cost variables. Experimental results were not consistent with a cost function containing any of the control and dynamic costs investigated. Movement patterns of all experimental conditions were adequately predicted by a kinematic cost function comprising both visually and somatosensory perceived jerk. The present study provides clear behavioral evidence that the brain solves kinematic and mechanical redundancy in separate steps: in a first step, movement kinematics are planned; and in a second, separate step, muscle activation patterns are generated.},

Here, we introduce a computational model of three-dimensional upper extremity movements that reproduces well-known features of reaching movements and is more biomechanically realistic than previous models. Critically, these features arise without the need of signal-dependent noise. We analyzed motor cortical neural activity from monkeys reaching to targets of different sizes. We found that the contribution of preparatory neural states to movement duration variability was greater for smaller targets than larger targets, and that movements to smaller targets exhibited less variability in preparatory neural states, but greater movement duration variability. Taken together, these results suggest that Fitts’ law emerges from greater task demands constraining the optimization landscape in a fashion that reduces the number of “good” control solutions (i.e., faster reaches). Thus, the speed-accuracy tradeoff could be a consequence of motor planning variability and optimal control theory, and not exclusively signal-dependent noise, as is currently held.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Significance Statement{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}A long-standing challenge in motor neuroscience is to understand the relationship between movement speed and accuracy, known as the speed-accuracy tradeoff.

Such high-fidelity modeling reveals that the speed-accuracy tradeoff as described by Fitts’ law emerges even without the presence of motor noise, which is commonly believed to underlie the speed-accuracy tradeoff. This suggests an alternative theory based on suboptimal control solutions. The crux of this theory is that some features of human movement are attributable to planning variability rather than execution noise.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Walking on uneven terrain is more energetically costly than walking on smooth ground, but the biomechanical factors that contribute to this increase are unknown. To identify possible factors, we constructed an uneven terrain treadmill that allowed us to record biomechanical, electromyographic and metabolic energetics data from human subjects. We hypothesized that walking on uneven terrain would increase step width and length variability, joint mechanical work and muscle co-activation compared with walking on smooth terrain. We tested healthy subjects (N=11) walking at 1.0 m s−1, and found that, when walking on uneven terrain with up to 2.5 cm variation, subjects decreased their step length by 4\% and did not significantly change their step width, while both step length and width variability increased significantly (22 and 36\%, respectively; P{\textless}0.05). Uneven terrain walking caused a 28 and 62\% increase in positive knee and hip work, respectively, and a 26\% greater magnitude of negative knee work (0.0106, 0.1078 and 0.0425 J kg−1, respectively; P{\textless}0.05). Mean muscle activity increased in seven muscles in the lower leg and thigh (P{\textless}0.05). These changes caused overall net metabolic energy expenditure to increase by 0.73 W kg−1 (28\%; P{\textless}0.0001). Much of that increase could be explained by the increased mechanical work observed at the knee and hip. Greater muscle co-activation could also contribute to increased energetic cost but to unknown degree. The findings provide insight into how lower limb muscles are used differently for natural terrain compared with laboratory conditions.},

We first indirectly assessed the metabolic cost of swinging the legs and then examined the cost of generating muscular force during the stance phase. Four men and four women walked at 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 m/s carrying loads equal to 0, 10, 20, and 30\% body mass positioned symmetrically about the waist. The net metabolic rate increased in nearly direct proportion to the external mechanical power during moderate-speed (0.5–1.5 m/s) load carrying, suggesting that the cost of swinging the legs is relatively small. The active muscle volume required to generate force on the ground and the rate of generating this force accounted for {\textgreater}85\% of the increase in net metabolic rate across moderate speeds and most loading conditions. Although these factors explained less of the increase in metabolic rate between 1.5 and 2.0 m/s (∼50\%), the cost of generating force per unit volume of active muscle [i.e., the cost coefficient (k)] was similar across all conditions [k = 0.11 ± 0.03 (SD) J/cm3]. These data indicate that, regardless of the work muscles do, the metabolic cost of walking can be largely explained by the cost of generating muscular force during the stance phase.},

	abstract = {Although humans clearly expend more energy to walk with an extra load, it is unclear what biomechanical mechanisms contribute to that increase. One possible contribution is the mechanical work performed on the body center of mass (COM), which simple models predict should increase linearly with added mass. The work should be performed primarily by the lower extremity joints, although in unknown distribution, and cost a proportionate amount of metabolic energy. We therefore tested normal adults (N=8) walking at constant speed (1.25 m s−1) with varying backpack loads up to 40\% of body weight. We measured mechanical work (both performed on the COM and joint work from inverse dynamics), as well as metabolic energy expenditure through respirometry. Both measures of work were found to increase approximately linearly with carried load, with COM work rate increasing by approximately 1.40 W for each 1 kg of additional load. The joints all contributed work, but the greatest increase in positive work was attributable to the ankle during push-off (45–60\% of stride time) and the knee in the rebound after collision (12–30\% stride). The hip performed increasing amounts of negative work, near the end of stance. Rate of metabolic energy expenditure also increased approximately linearly with load, by approximately 7.6 W for each 1 kg of additional load. The ratio of the increases in work and metabolic cost yielded a relatively constant efficiency of approximately 16\%. The metabolic cost not explained by work appeared to be relatively constant with load and did not exhibit a particular trend. Most of the increasing cost for carrying a load appears to be explained by positive mechanical work, especially about the ankle and knee, with both work and metabolic cost increasing nearly linearly with added mass.},

Objectives
To test the hypothesis that reducing vertical center of mass (COM) displacement will lower the metabolic cost of human walking. To examine changes in joint work associated with increasing and decreasing vertical COM movement during gait.
Design
Randomized repeated measures.
Setting
Human Neuromechanics Laboratory, University of Michigan.
Participants
Able-bodied subjects (N=10).
Interventions
Subjects walked at 1.2m/s on a treadmill and overground. Subjects manipulated vertical COM displacement either by adjusting stride length or by using visual feedback to reduce COM movement.
Main Outcome Measures
We measured kinematic and kinetic data to calculate vertical and lateral COM displacements, joint torques, and work. In addition, we collected oxygen consumption to calculated metabolic power.
Results
Increasing and decreasing vertical COM displacement beyond subjects' preferred range resulted in increases in the metabolic cost of walking. When vertical COM displacement was reduced, corresponding increases in positive ankle and hip work and negative knee work were observed.
Conclusions
Humans are capable of walking in a manner that will reduce COM displacement from normal. Decreasing vertical COM movement results in increases in metabolic energy costs because of greater mechanical work performed at the hip, knee, and ankle joints. Thus, reducing vertical COM movement is not a successful strategy for improving either metabolic or mechanical energy economy during normal walking by able-bodied subjects.},

Further, humans prefer to walk at speeds that approximately minimize their metabolic energy expenditure per unit distance (i.e. gross cost of transport, COT). This has been found in a variety of population groups and other species. However, these studies were mostly performed on smooth, level ground or on treadmills. We hypothesized that the objective function for walking is more complex than only minimizing the COT. To test this idea, we compared the preferred speeds and the relationships between COT and speed for people walking on both a smooth, level floor and a rough, natural terrain trail. Rough terrain presumably introduces other factors, such as stability, to the objective function. Ten healthy men walked on both a straight, flat, smooth floor and an outdoor trail strewn with rocks and boulders. In both locations, subjects performed five to seven trials at different speeds relative to their preferred speed. The COT–speed relationships were similarly U-shaped for both surfaces, but the COT values on rough terrain were approximately 115\% greater. On the smooth surface, the preferred speed (1.24±0.17 m s−1) was not found to be statistically different (P=0.09) than the speed that minimized COT (1.34±0.03 m s−1). On rough terrain, the preferred speed (1.07±0.05 m s−1) was significantly slower than the COT minimum speed (1.13±0.07 m s−1; P=0.02). Because near the optimum speed the COT function is very shallow, these changes in speed result in a small change in COT (0.5\%). It appears that the objective function for speed preference when walking on rough terrain includes COT and additional factors such as stability.},

	abstract = {Basing higher-order decisions on expected value (reward probability × reward magnitude) maximizes an agent's accruement of reward over time. The goal of this study was to determine whether the advanced preparation of simple actions reflected the expected value of the potential outcomes. Human subjects were required to direct a saccadic eye movement to a visual target that was presented either to the left or right of a central fixation point on each trial. Expected value was manipulated by adjusting the probability of presenting each target and their associated magnitude of monetary reward across 15 blocks of trials. We found that saccadic reaction times (SRTs) were negatively correlated to the relative expected value of the targets. Occasionally, an irrelevant visual distractor was presented before the target to probe the spatial allocation of saccadic preparation. Distractor-directed errors (oculomotor captures) varied as a function of the relative expected value of, and the distance of distractors from, the potential valued targets. SRTs and oculomotor captures were better correlated to the relative expected value of actions than to reward probability, reward magnitude, or overall motivation. Together, our results suggest that the level and spatial distribution of competitive dynamic neural fields representing saccadic preparation reflect the relative expected value of the potential actions.},

The control strategy during targeted movements may also take into account the rewards or costs of any outcomes that may occur. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that movement time in Fitts’ Law emerges not only from the accuracy constraints of the task, but also depends on the perceived cost of error for missing the targets. Subjects were asked to touch targets on an iPad® screen with different costs for missed targets. We manipulated the probability of error by comparing children with dystonia (who are characterized by increased intrinsic motor variability) to typically developing children. The results show a strong effect of the cost of error on the Fitts’ Law relationship characterized by an increase in movement time as cost increased. In addition, we observed a greater sensitivity to increased cost for children with dystonia, and this behavior appears to minimize the average cost. The findings support a proposed mathematical model that explains how movement time in a Fitts-like task is related to perceived risk.},

The former is the topic of an overwhelming wealth of theoretical and empirical work particularly in the fields of reinforcement learning and decision-making, with various forms of affective prediction error playing key roles. Although vigor concerns motivation, and so is the subject of many empirical studies in diverse fields, it has suffered a dearth of computational models. Recently, Niv et al. [Niv, Y., Daw, N. D., Joel, D., \& Dayan, P. Tonic dopamine: Opportunity costs and the control of response vigor. Psychopharmacology (Berlin), 191, 507-520, 2007] suggested that vigor should be controlled by the opportunity cost of time, which is itself determined by the average rate of reward. This coupling of reward rate and vigor can be shown to be optimal under the theory of average return reinforcement learning for a particular class of tasks but may also be a more general, perhaps hard-wired, characteristic of the architecture of control. We, therefore, tested the hypothesis that healthy human participants would adjust their RTs on the basis of the average rate of reward. We measured RTs in an odd-ball discrimination task for rewards whose magnitudes varied slowly but systematically. Linear regression on the subjects' individual RTs using the time varying average rate of reward as the regressor of interest, and including nuisance regressors such as the immediate reward in a round and in the preceding round, showed that a significant fraction of the variance in subjects' RTs could indeed be explained by the rate of experienced reward. This validates one of the key proposals associated with the model, illuminating an apparently mandatory form of coupling that may involve tonic levels of dopamine.},

	abstract = {Recent findings have demonstrated that reward feedback alone can drive motor learning. However, it is not yet clear whether reward feedback alone can lead to learning when a perturbation is introduced abruptly, or how a reward gradient can modulate learning. In this study, we provide reward feedback that decays continuously with increasing error. We asked whether it is possible to learn an abrupt visuomotor rotation by reward alone, and if the learning process could be modulated by combining reward and sensory feedback and/or by using different reward landscapes. We designed a novel visuomotor learning protocol during which subjects experienced an abruptly introduced rotational perturbation. Subjects received either visual feedback or reward feedback, or a combination of the two. Two different reward landscapes, where the reward decayed either linearly or cubically with distance from the target, were tested. Results demonstrate that it is possible to learn from reward feedback alone and that the combination of reward and sensory feedback accelerates learning. An analysis of the underlying mechanisms reveals that although reward feedback alone does not allow for sensorimotor remapping, it can nonetheless lead to broad generalization, highlighting a dissociation between remapping and generalization. Also, the combination of reward and sensory feedback accelerates learning without compromising sensorimotor remapping. These findings suggest that the use of reward feedback is a promising approach to either supplement or substitute sensory feedback in the development of improved neurorehabilitation techniques. More generally, they point to an important role played by reward in the motor learning process.},

	abstract = {Modeling human motor control and predicting how humans will move in novel environments is a grand scientiﬁc challenge. Despite advances in neuroscience techniques, it is still diﬃcult to measure and interpret the activity of the millions of neurons involved in motor control. Thus, researchers in the ﬁelds of biomechanics and motor control have proposed and evaluated motor control models via neuromechanical simulations, which produce physically correct motions of a musculoskeletal model. Typically, researchers have developed control models that encode physiologically plausible motor control hypotheses and compared the resulting simulation behaviors to measurable human motion data. While such plausible control models were able to simulate and explain many basic locomotion behaviors (e.g. walking, running, and climbing stairs), modeling higher layer controls (e.g. processing environment cues, planning long-term motion strategies, and coordinating basic motor skills to navigate in dynamic and complex environments) remains a challenge. Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning lay a foundation for modeling these complex control processes and controlling a diverse repertoire of human movement; however, reinforcement learning has been rarely applied in neuromechanical simulation to model human control. In this paper, we review the current state of neuromechanical simulations, along with the fundamentals of reinforcement learning, as it applies to human locomotion. We also present a scientiﬁc competition and accompanying software platform, which we have organized to accelerate the use of reinforcement learning in neuromechanical simulations. This “Learn to Move” competition, which we have run annually since 2017 at the NeurIPS conference, has attracted over 1300 teams from around the world. Top teams adapted state-of-art deep reinforcement learning techniques to produce complex motions, such as quick turning and walk-to-stand transitions, that have not been demonstrated before in neuromechanical simulations without utilizing reference motion data. We close with a discussion of future opportunities at the intersection of human movement simulation and reinforcement learning and our plans to extend the Learn to Move competition to further facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration in modeling human motor control for biomechanics and rehabilitation research.},

According to their clustering along the reaction time scale the modes could be classified into express (90–120 msec), fast regular (135–170 msec) and slow regular (200–220 msec) modes. Among the unimodal distributions 29\% had peaks in the range of the express mode and 46\% had peaks in the range of the fast regular mode. Therefore, 87\% of the data sets support the notion of saccadic reaction time distributions being the superposition of three modes.

	abstract = {The mechanical properties of the human arm are regulated to maintain stability across many tasks. The static mechanics of the arm can be characterized by estimates of endpoint stiffness, considered especially relevant for the maintenance of posture. At a fixed posture, endpoint stiffness can be regulated by changes in muscle activation, but which activation-dependent muscle properties contribute to this global measure of limb mechanics remains unclear. We evaluated the role of muscle properties in the regulation of endpoint stiffness by incorporating scalable models of muscle stiffness into a three-dimensional musculoskeletal model of the human arm. Two classes of muscle models were tested: one characterizing short-range stiffness and two estimating stiffness from the slope of the force-length curve. All models were compared with previously collected experimental data describing how endpoint stiffness varies with changes in voluntary force. Importantly, muscle properties were not fit to the experimental data but scaled only by the geometry of individual muscles in the model. We found that force-dependent variations in endpoint stiffness were accurately described by the short-range stiffness of active arm muscles. Over the wide range of evaluated arm postures and voluntary forces, the musculoskeletal model incorporating short-range stiffness accounted for 98 ± 2, 91 ± 4, and 82 ± 12\% of the variance in stiffness orientation, shape, and area, respectively, across all simulated subjects. In contrast, estimates based on muscle force-length curves were less accurate in all measures, especially stiffness area. These results suggest that muscle short-range stiffness is a major contributor to endpoint stiffness of the human arm. Furthermore, the developed model provides an important tool for assessing how the nervous system may regulate endpoint stiffness via changes in muscle activation.},

	abstract = {Human locomotion has been studied thoroughly, but sequences of muscle forces providing for coordinated gait are not well understood. We have approached this problem indirectly by computing such sequences under different optimality criteria involving minimization of muscular forces. Experimental kinematic and ground reaction measurements along with EMG data from the same subjects obtained during level walking enables us to select J=Z(Fi/F,,,,J2 as the most feasible criterion. The results are discussed in terms of the economy and neurological control of locomotion.},
