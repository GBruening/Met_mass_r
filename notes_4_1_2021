Efficiency - Reward*P(R)/Effort
Need P(R) Cause alpha woulnd't change then.
Use gross as main, then try with net rate


Get the movement durations for predictions
Add these back in.
	Utility, additive, gross cost - make table of absolute numbers and self-select speed



Dicsussion:
Probability function
	First to predict duration including speed accuracy
	Traumerhizer studies - Variability at fixed distances
	Megans (JNP) studies - optimal distnace not duration
		where you should reach and how far
	but doesn't say how fast

LImitions of other models
	additive, metabolic
	additive - No effect of reward (Alpha)
	metabolic - only one experiment, target sizes/reward
	efficney - Breaks with accuracy

	Metabolic minima isn't needed
	Add metabolic cost is good at changes
	Just because met opt doesn't predict, doesn't mean energy is not important.

Offset?
	Na, don't do it
